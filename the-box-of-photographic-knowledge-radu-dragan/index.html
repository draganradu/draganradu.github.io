The field rate was changed by 1/1.001 - from 60 to 59.94 frames per second. Older B&amp;W TVs could receive color broadcasts and show them in B&amp;W and the new color information could be encoded into the broadcast signal so that the new color TVs would show the broadcasts in color. Today, digital and HD signals have to fit in; 24, 30, and 60 frames/fields per second become 23.98, 29.97, and 59.94 to be compatible with existing NTSC formats and workflows.</p><p class='span'>canon USA</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>1080/24p</h2><p>Internationally standardized High Definition production format ITU BT 709 has a digital sampling structure of 1920 (H) x 1080 (V) and operates at 24 frames per second progressively scanned.

While progressive video is too large for broadcast, 1080i exists primarily for broadcast use, as the lower frame rate allows the signal to be sent over 60 Hz systems.

The frame rate is slowed from 24 fps to 23.976 fps (a factor of 1000/1001) and a 3:2 field cadence is created. This is done by taking one frame of the 24 frame source and filling three of the 59.94 fields, with the next frame of the 24 frame source filling only two of the 59.94 fields, the next frame three fields, the next two fields, and so on. This results in four of the 24 frame per second original material fitting into five frames of the destination 59.94i video. Pulldown now describes any combination of 1000/1001 speed change and/or 3:2 cadence creation.

The 3D Color Matrix Meter II takes into account the scene's contrast and brightness, the subject's distance (via a D- or G-type NIKKOR lens), the color of the subject within the scene and RGB color values in every section of the scene. 3D Color Matrix Metering II also uses special exposure-evaluation algorithms, optimized for digital imaging, that detect highlight areas. The meter then accesses a database of over 30,000 actual images to determine the best exposure for the scene. Once the camera receives the scene data, its powerful microcomputer and the database work together to provide the finest automatic exposure control available.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>4</a> [ <strong>3d focus tracking </strong> ] An invaluable feature for sports, action and wildlife photography, 3D focus tracking, available in select Nikon D-SLRs, automatically shifts the focus point to follow the movement of the subject. With the shutter release pressed halfway, you'll see in the viewfinder the lens continuously maintain focus as the subject moves.However, maintaining focus doesn't guarantee a sharp image, as there is a short time lag between the release of the shutter and the capture of the picture. To solve this problem, the focus tracking system is a predictive system that uses special algorithms to forecast the position of the subject at the moment the image is captured. The prediction is based on a measurement of the subject's movement and speed.Simple predictive tracking is very effective for pictures of a subject moving at constant speed toward the camera, but to provide maximum focusing performance for a subject that abruptly changes direction at high speed, or a subject with low contrast, moving randomly, the AF system must accumulate subject location data using multiple focus areas. The AF modules built into selected Nikon D-SLRs have as many as 51 focus areas that can detect vertical, horizontal and diagonal movement of the subject.To realize high-precision AF for high-speed continuous shooting of a fast-moving subject, the processing speed of the AF cycle is vital. To provide that speed, a Nikon proprietary technology called overlap servo prepares for the focus detection of the next shot while the lens-driving operation for the current shot is in process.</p><p><a title='Kodak cine'>5</a> [ <strong>3d lut</strong> ]  A 3-dimensional lookup table is a static color translation table that converts a set of three input color values to another set of three output color values.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>6</a> [ <strong>3d matrix metering </strong> ] An exclusive Nikon feature, Matrix metering applies three types of data to calculate exposure: scene brightness, scene contrast and the focused subject‚Äôs distance (which requires the use of a D-type NIKKOR lens).</p><p><a title='Fotomagazine'>7</a> [ <strong>3d matrix ~ masurare</strong> ] Metoda de evaluare a expunerii folosita de Nikon, care foloseste trei tipuri de date: luminozitatea scenei, contrastul scenei si distanta de focalizare (furinizata de obiectivele Nikkor D). </p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>8</a> [ <strong>3d mode </strong> ] The Nikon COOLPIX S100 digital camera offers a 3D mode, which in effect takes two images that are played back on a 3D compatible TV or monitor for stereoscopic viewing.</p><p><a title='Fotomagazine'>9</a> [ <strong>3d multi-sensor balanced fill-flash</strong> ] Sistem automat, folosit de Nikon, de calculare a intensitatii de descarcare a blitzului, prin care se emite o serie de pre-flashuri, imediat inainte de expunerea propriu-zisa, iar lumina reflectata este receptionata si analizata de un procesor. </p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>10</a> [ <strong>3d multi-sensor balanced fill-flash </strong> ] An automatic, balanced fill-flash system in which the flash fires a series of pre-flashes just before the first shutter curtain moves. </p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>11</a> [ <strong>3d playback mode </strong> ] Only 3D images can be viewed in the 3D Playback Mode.

									<p><a title='bhphotovideo'>1</a> [ <strong>aberration</strong> ] A distortion of image quality or color rendition in a photographic image caused by optical limitations of the lens used for image capture. Aberrations commonly show up in the form of halation around high-contrast portions of the image, or smearing of color toward the edges of the frame. Aspheric lens surfaces and advanced lens coatings are often used in more expensive or complex lenses as a means of reducing aberrations. For more on this subject, see the explora article</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>2</a> [ <strong>aberration</strong> ] Optical problem in a camera lens that produces slight errors in subject appearance, usually noticeable in small details. </p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>3</a> [ <strong>aberration</strong> ] The image formed by an ideal photographic lens would have the following characteristics:A point would be formed as a point. A plane (such as a wall) perpendicular to the optical axis would be formed as a plane. The image formed by the lens would have the same shape as the subject. Also, from the standpoint of image expression, a lens should exhibit true color reproduction. If only light rays entering the lens close to the optical axis are used and the light is monochromatic (one specific wavelength), it is possible to realize virtually ideal lens performance. With real photographic lenses, however, where a large aperture is used to obtain sufficient brightness and the lens must converge light not only from near the optical axis but from all areas of the image, it is extremely difficult to satisfy the above-mentioned ideal conditions due to the existence of the following obstructive factors:Since most lenses are constructed solely of lens elements with spherical surfaces, light rays from a single subject point are not formed in the image as a perfect point. (A problem unavoidable with spherical surfaces.) The focal point position differs for different types (i.e., different wavelengths) of light. There are many requirements related to changes in angle of view (especially with wide-angle, zoom and telephoto lenses). The general term used to describe the difference between an ideal image and the actual image affected by the above factors is aberration. Thus, to design a high-performance lens, aberration must be extremely small, with the ultimate objective being to obtain an image as close as possible to the ideal image. Aberration can be broadly divided into two classifications: chromatic aberrations, which occur due to differences in wavelength, and monochromatic aberrations, which occur even for a single wavelength.</p><p><a title='ProFotos Education Glossary'>4</a> [ <strong>aberration </strong> ]  the inability of a lens to produce a perfect, sharp image, especially towards the edge of the lens field. These faults can be reduced by compound lens constructions, and the use of small apertures.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>5</a> [ <strong>aberration </strong> ] -(1) Something that prevents light from being brought into sharp focus, disenabling the formation of a clear image.(2) Lens flaw - the inability of a lens to reproduce an accurate, focused, sharp image. Aberration in simple lenses is sub-categorized into seven types: Astigmatism - lines in some directions are focused less sharply than lines in other directions, Chromatic aberration or Axial chromatic aberration - different wavelengths of light coming into focus in front of and behind the film plane, resulting in points of light exhibiting a rainbow-like halo and reduction in sharpness, Coma - the image of a point source of light cannot be brought into focus, but has instead a comet shape, Curvilinear distortion - distortion consisting of curved lines, Field curvature - the image is incorrectly curved, Lateral chromatic aberration also known as Transverse chromatic aberration - variation in the magnification at the sides of a lens (this aberration type used to be termed 'lateral color'), Spherical aberration - variation in focal length of a lens from center to edge due to its spherical shape - generally all parts of the image, including its center.The effects of lens aberration usually increase with increases in aperture.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>6</a> [ <strong>aberration </strong> ] An aberration prevents light from being brought into sharp focus. The ideal image by lenses (especially photographic lenses), must fulfill three key conditions, namely, 1. all light from the point object must be focused to a single point on the image plane (film or digital sensor); 2. when the object plane is perpendicular to the optical axis, the image plane must also be perpendicular; and 3. the object and the image (on the film or imaging sensor) must closely resemble each other. In reality, however, light refraction by the lens causes a variety of defects in the image, called aberration. The five most common types in aberration are SEIDEL's five aberrations, which occur even with monochromatic (single-wavelength) light. In addition, there are also two types of chromatic aberrations, which are caused by more than one frequency. It is impossible to eliminate them all, but in the lens design process, they can be controlled and balanced to provide the best possible result for that lens and application. This is handled by material (glass) selection, shape and positioning.</p><p class='span'>6 | ABERRATION </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>aberration. </h2><p>Failing in the ability of a lens to produce a true image. There are many forms ofaberration and the lens designer can often correct some only by allowing others toremain. Generally, the more expensive the lens, the less its aberrations (More attentionto optical quality). While no single lens is called a 'perfect lens'. The ''ideal'' lense would reproducea subject in a faithful, clearly defined image on film. Aberrations, which can bedivided into six basic faults, affect the Ideal performance in an optical system.a) Spherical aberration. Basically, a beam of light passing through a lensparallel to the optical axis converges to form 3 focused image on the film. Sphericalaberration is the term for an optical fault caused by the spherical form of a lensethat produces different focus points along the axis for central and marginal rays.b) Curvature of field.This optical defect causes points on an object plane perpendicular to the lens axisto focus on a curved surface rather than a plane.c) Astigmatism. Rays of light from a single point of an object which is noton the axis of a lense fail to meet in a single focus thus causing the image of apoint to be drawn out into two sharp lines, one radial to the optical axis and anotherperpendicular to this line, in two different planes near the curvature of field.d) Coma. This opticaldefect causes the image of an off-axis point of light to appear as a comet-shapedblur of light. Coma, as well as curvature of field and astigmatism, degenerate theimage forming ability of the lense at the rims of the picture.e) Distortion. Even if the first four aberrations were totally eliminated,images could result that still have a distorted appearance. For an example, an rectanglemay appear as a barrel or pin cushion-shaped object.f) Chromatic aberration. This aberration is caused by light rays of differentwavelengths coming to focus at different distances from the lense. Blue will focusat the shortest distance and red at the greatest distance. Since the natural raysof light are a mixture of colors, each aberration will give a different value correspondingto each color thus producing blurred images.</p><p class='span'>Mir glossary</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>abjad</h2><p>Abjad is the technical term for the type of writing system used by Semitic languages (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.), where there are glyphs for all the consonants but the reader must be prepared to guess what vowel to add between two consonants.Both Hebrew and Arabic have optional vowel marks and are called 'impure' abjads.

With good light control and a static subject, Single Point AF ensures that the most important element in the composition, such as the eyes in a portrait, will be sharply focused. With Dynamic Area AF, you can select from several focusing options: 9-, 21- or all 51-point AF. Select a Single AF point and the areas surrounding it serve as backup‚Äîa significant advantage when shooting moving subjects. Select the 9-point option when you want to focus on erratically moving subjects with greater accuracy. When dealing with insufficient contrast for fast focus detection, choosing 21 or 51 points makes detection easier. The 51-point option also allows for 3D Focus Tracking, which uses color information from the RGB metering sensor to automatically follow moving subjects across the AF points. Auto Area AF uses color information and special face recognition algorithms to automatically focus on an individual's face, which is extremely helpful when there's simply no time to select a focus point, or when using Live View in hand-held mode at high or low angles.</p><p><a title='Fotomagazine'>7</a> [ <strong>af asist illuminator</strong> ] Spot luminos emis automat de camera spre subiect, pentru a usura autofocalizarea in conditii de lumina putina.

Image stabilization can be achieved in the lens or in the camera body. In-camera image stabilization is achieved by mounting the camera sensor on a floating micro-geared stage that rapidly shifts the sensor in the opposite direction of the camera s movement, which effectively cancels out the image movement. With in-camera image stabilization, the benefits of the system can be realized with The alternative method of canceling camera movement is by employing a gyroscopically driven floating element in the rear portion of the lens that rapidly shifts the element in the opposite direction of the camera movement. Needless to say, either process is quite complex and requires extreme high-speed data processing coupled with precision lens/sensor movements to achieve the desired effect.The ultimate benefit of image stabilization technology is that it enables you to handhold a camera several shutter speeds slower than non-image-stabilization-enabled cameras or lenses.

Aperture controls depth of field - how much of the image, from foreground to background, appears sharp. A large aperture allows in both light rays directed straight at the lens (which produce a sharp image) and those coming in at angles (which appear blurry). The smaller the aperture, the fewer of these off-angle light rays enter the lens, allowing more of the image to appear sharp. Aperture is measured in a unit called f-stops, in which smaller numbers actually represent larger openings. An aperture of f1.4 (which only a few lenses can achieve), for example, is a very wide opening that puts very little of the image in focus. An aperture of f/32 (also rare) makes essentially everything in a sweeping landscape sharp.Between those extremes are aperture values that produce varying depth of field.</p><p><a title='kodak glosarry 1999'>3</a> [ <strong>aperture</strong> ]  Lens opening.

Faster lenses have wider apertures, which in turn allow for faster shutter speeds. The wider the aperture is set, the shallower the depth of field will be in the resulting image.Wider apertures allow for selective focus, the ability to isolate your subject from background and foreground elements within the frame. Conversely, if you stop the lens aperture down to its smallest openings, you increase the depth of field, or the amount of focus from foreground to background. Generally speaking, most lenses display the highest level of resolving power when set to about three stops down from the widest aperture.The term highest level of resolving power does not mean the greatest level of depth of field.

Thus, f/8 allows in half as much light as f/5.6, and twice as much light as f/11.</p><p class='span'>2 | APERTURE: </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>apex</h2>

									<p><a title='ephotozine'>1</a> [ <strong>aps</strong> ] Advanced Photo System, a camera and film system designed jointly by Kodak, Fuji, Nikon, Canon and Minolta. The film cartridge, with a slightly smaller film than 35 mm film, is as easy to load as a battery film as it slots effortlessly into a chamber on the camera, and can be exchanged for another film without having to finish the roll. It also has a status indictor on one end showing if the film is unused, partially used, used but unprocessed or processed. So you won't hand in an unexposed roll for processing or put a film through the camera twice and double expose everything. The system allows the photographer to have his settings recorded on the back of his prints, which is automatically done by the processing lab. Although a few APS SLR models were made by Canon and one other manufacturer, most APS cameras tend to be compact and easy to use, but they are often less versatile than 35mm cameras at equivalent price points. The APS system is now regarded as an interim product, used only by consumers, which was popular for a short time, until better compact cameras became available at affordable prices. Most manufacturers have discontinued production of APS cameras. APS film is still available here and there, and processing labs still accept APS film. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>2</a> [ <strong>aps </strong> ]  Acronym for 'Advanced Photo System'.</p><p><a title='ProFotos Education Glossary'>3</a> [ <strong>aps (advanced photo system) </strong> ]  consumer photography developed by Kodak and four other companies Canon, Fuji, Minolta and Nikon .

									<p><a title='ephotozine'>1</a> [ <strong>aps-c</strong> ] Advanced Photo System type-C should not be confused with the Advanced Photographic System (APS) camera/film system, since the former is digital and the latter is analogue. APS-C is a type of image sensor found in certain digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. These sensors are smaller than the ones used for the conventional 36 mm x 24 mm (35 mm) sensor SLR cameras (also called full frame DSLR cameras). Being smaller causes a 1.x multiplier for the effect of the focal distance of the lenses, in comparison with the effect of those lenses on conventional 35 mm film SLR cameras or full frame digital SLR cameras. Several manufacturers produce cameras with an APS-C sensor and some even make lenses especially for them. These lenses are found in the Canon EF-S, Nikon DX, Pentax DA and Sigma DC ranges, to name the most popular ones. The most common multiplier ratios are 1.6 (Canon), 1.5 (Nikon, Fuji, Sony, etc.), 1.3 (Canon). (1.3 crop sensors are also sometimes called APS-H.) Most manufacturers not only produce cameras with these cropped sensors, but also offer DSLR cameras with full frame sensors. </p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>2</a> [ <strong>aps-c</strong> ] Designation for an imaging sensor measuring approximately 22.3 x 14.9mm.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>3</a> [ <strong>aps-c </strong> ] APS-C stands for Advanced Photo System-type C, which is an image sensor format that is equivalent to approximately the size of the Advanced Photo System negative (25.1x16.7mm).

The name is derived from the APS (Advanced Photo System) film format that was introduced in 1996 for the amateur point-and-shoot market. The APS format is about half the size (23.6 x 15.8mm) of a standard 35mm frame (24 x 36mm) and has a 1.5x magnification factor (multiply the focal length x 1.5) for determining the 35mm equivalent focal length of lenses used on APS-C format cameras. APS-C format DSLRs from Nikon, Pentax, Fujifilm, and Sony (Alpha) contain APS-C sized imaging sensors.Canon compact DSLRs, which include EOS Rebel-series DSLRs, contain APS-C format imaging sensors that are slightly smaller than competitive compact DSLRs (22.3 x 14.9mm, so the lens factor for these cameras would be 1.6x). Although it does further reduce the effective field of view of your lenses, they are slightly more telephoto than their 1.5x brethren.For more on crop factor, see the explora article, ://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-crop-factor Understanding Crop Factor.</p><p><a title='DXO Glossary'>6</a> [ <strong>aps-c sensor</strong> ] Image sensor approximately the size of an APS (Advanced Photo System) negative (roughly 25.1x16.7 mm.)</p><p class='span'>6 | APS-C SENSOR</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>aps-h</h2>

Generally, an aspherical lens deviates slightly from an exactly spherical shape, and is relatively free from aberrations. Light rays are bent more at the edges of a conventional spherical lens than they are at the center, causing them to come into focus before the film plane or sensor plane. A lens made with aspherical elements focuses all the light rays passing through it on the film/sensor plane.</p><p class='span'>Photo Tips</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>aspherical lens</h2>
									<p><a title='All things photography'>1</a> [ <strong>aspherical lens</strong> ]  A lens with edges flattened so that it is not a perfect sphere. These produce a much superior image.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>2</a> [ <strong>aspherical lens</strong> ] A lens element that doesn't form part of a sphere. This is physically difficult to manufacture as most grinding/polishing equipment operates with a spherical action. This sort of lens is often moulded out of plastic or coated onto a glass element. </p><p><a title='Mir glossary'>3</a> [ <strong>aspherical lens</strong> ] A lens whose curvedsurface does not conform to the shape of a sphere; lenses are usually ground or moldedwith spherical surfaces; because a spherical surface lens has difficulty in correctingdistortion in ultra-wideangle lenses or coma in large-aperture lenses brought aboutby spherical aberration, an aspherical lens is used.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>4</a> [ <strong>aspherical lens</strong> ] Photographic lenses are generally constructed of several single lens elements, all of which, unless otherwise specified, have spherical surfaces. Because all surfaces are spherical, it becomes especially difficult to correct spherical aberration in large-aperture lenses and distortion in super-wide-angle lenses. A special lens element with a surface curved with the ideal shape to correct these aberrations, i.e., a lens having a free-curved surface which is not spherical, is called an aspherical lens. The theory and usefulness of aspherical lenses have been known since the early days of lens making, but due to the extreme difficulty of actually processing and accurately measuring aspherical surfaces, practical aspherical lens manufacturing methods were not realized until fairly recently. The first SLR photographic lens to incorporate an aspherical lens was Canon's FD 55mm f/1.2AL released in March 1971. (Leica offered the 50mm f/1.2 Noctilux lens with aspherical surfaces for its rangefinder cameras many years before 1971.) Due to revolutionary advances in production technology since that time, Canon's current EF lens group makes abundant use of various aspherical lens types such as ground and polished glass aspherical lens elements, ultra-precision glass molded (GMo) aspherical lens elements, composite aspherical lens elements and replica aspherical lens elements.</p><p><a title='ProFotos Education Glossary'>5</a> [ <strong>aspherical lens </strong> ]  lens with a curved, nonspherical surface.

Used to reduce aberrations and enable a more compact lens size. Aspherical lenses minimize coma and other types of lens aberrations, even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting distortion in wide-angle lenses and help contribute to a lighter, more compact design by reducing the number of standard (spherical) elements necessary. Aspherical lens elements correct these distortions by continuously changing the refractive index from the center of the lens.</p><p><a title='ProFotos Education Glossary'>7</a> [ <strong>aspherical surface</strong> ]  lens surface with more than one radius of curvature, i.e. the surface does not form part of a sphere.</p><p><a title='bhphotovideo'>8</a> [ <strong>aspherical surface</strong> ] An Aspherical lens surface possesses more than one radius of curvature, which allows for the correction of lens aberrations that are common in simpler lens designs. Sharper definition toward the edges of an image is the most common benefit of a lens containing aspheric elements.

									<p><a title='imdb Movie Terminology'>1</a> [ <strong>auteur</strong> ] A filmmaker, generally a director, who creates a body of work with a unified sensibility that reveals, through the interplay of themes and styles, a personal worldview. The term originated with Fran√ßois Truffaut, whose 1954 essay 'Une certaine tendence du cin√©ma fran√ßais' put forth the idea that the most interesting films were those that functioned as a medium of personal expression--and therefore bore the distinctive imprint of their 'author.' American critic Andrew Sarris later translated and expanded this idea into an 'auteur theory,' which proposed an evaluation of films based on their context within the filmmaker's oeuvre, rather than for their technical proficiency or greater historical significance. The term 'auteur' later came to refer to any filmmaker who performed or was intimately involved in all aspects of the moviemaking process (writing, directing, producing, editing, etc.).</p><p><a title='Penn State Integrative Arts department'>2</a> [ <strong>auteur (french for author) </strong> ]  literally the director, who is regarded as the author of a film because he/she has primary control and responsibility for the final product.

It will fill in and open up shadowed areas in order to portray the greatest detail in subjects. It's also ideal when using wide aperture lenses, and because it allows up to the fastest shutter speeds on compatible Nikon DSLRs, it is often used for action-stopping sports photography. And for portraits, you can open up your lenses to their full aperture in order to isolate your subject against a blurred background without overexposing the image. When Auto FP High Speed Sync is selected, the flash will fire for the duration of the shutter curtain's travel, thus syncing with the camera's shutter speed when that speed is set higher than the camera's normal sync speed.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>13</a> [ <strong>auto iso </strong> ] Auto ISO or ISO Auto is a feature that allows you to tell the camera to choose which ISO to use if certain parameters are met. For instance, when there is enough light to use ISO 100, the camera does so, but when it would have to use too slow a shutter speed, then it automatically increases the ISO to 200 and maintains a high enough shutter speed to avoid camera shake. Some Nikon digital cameras let you choose from a range that you're willing to shoot within, such as ISO 400 ‚Äì 800. </p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>14</a> [ <strong>auto lighting optimizer</strong> ] Image-quality tool handling tricky lighting conditions, lightening dark areas of a scene, if necessary, while ensuring bright areas maintain tonal detail, automatically adjusts contrast and brightness, maintaining highlight details.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>15</a> [ <strong>auto slow sync </strong> ] Auto Slow Sync is a flash mode that is used when shooting portraits at night. </p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>16</a> [ <strong>auto slow sync red eye </strong> ] Auto Slow Sync Red-Eye is a flash mode that combines Red-Eye reduction with Slow Sync.

See: White Balance for more colorful details.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>18</a> [ <strong>auto white balance </strong> ] In Nikon D-SLRs, Auto White Balance combines with the Scene Recognition System to analyze each scene's light sources, cross-referencing this information with 5,000 actual picture data examples from over 20,000 images in the camera's onboard white balance database. A digital camera's white balance setting compensates for the different colors of various light sources‚Äîfluorescent, which has a green cast, or a cooler-than-daylight light balance; incandescent, which has a yellow or a warmer-than-daylight white balance; and daylight‚Äîso that white objects in a scene appear white regardless of the color temperature (the warmth or coolness) of the light source. Even under mixed lighting or difficult light sources like mercury vapor lights, auto white balance technology calculates an ideal white balance for remarkably faithful colors.

The theory behind exposure bracketing is that the photographer is not certain that the main exposure is best for the subject matter, and the subsequent different exposures will provide 'insurance' that at least one of the images will be acceptably exposed. Sometimes, though, the photographer may simply want to see the effects of different exposures of a scene. The term 'bracket' is analogous with grammatical brackets or parentheses, where they are located on either end of a phrase.

For many countries, movies are required to be advertised as having a particular 'certificate' or 'rating', forewarning audiences of possible 'objectionable content'. The nature of this 'objectionable content' is determined mainly by contemporary national, social, religious, and political standards. The usual criteria which determine a film's certificate are violence and sexuality, with 'mature' (adult) situations and especially blasphemy and political issues often being considered more important outside the Western world. This is by no means a hard and fast rule; see the Hays Production Code for an example. In some cases, a film classification board exhibits censorship by demanding changes be made to a movie in order to receive a certain rating. As many movies are targetted at a particular age group, studios must balance the content of their films against the demands of the classification board. Negotiations are common; studios agree to make certain changes to films in order to receive the required rating. The IMDb uses the term 'Certificate' as opposed to 'Rating' to avoid confusion with 'ratings' meaning the opinions of critics.

									<p><a title='All things photography'>1</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ]  Also known as purple fringing. It is fairly common in 2MP digital cameras and above, especially if they have long telephoto lenses. You can see it when a dark area is surrounded by a highlight. In between the dark and light, you may see a band of purple pixels that shouldn‚Äôt be there. There are ways of removing this which I have covered in the Photoshop section.</p><p><a title='Digital Photography School Speeking photography'>2</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ]  in terms of lens optics it is the failure of the lens to focus all colours (RGB) at the same point. It shows up as colour fringes in areas of the image where dark meet light (think edge of a building against the sky). It is more common in wide angle lenses, and those of inferior optics (kit lenses). It is correctable, to some degree, using Photoshop, Lightroom or software of your choice.</p><p><a title='Tom`s Guide'>3</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ]  ‚Äì Also known as 'color fringing,' this distortion appears when the camera lens fails to focus on all the colors where two points of high contrast meet (such as where the dark roof of a building meets the sky). Chromatic aberration appears as green or purple fringing at the point of contrast.</p><p><a title='RadioShak support'>4</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ] A fringing effect around the edges, which is caused by lens not focusing correctly</p><p><a title='Mir glossary'>5</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ] A lens aberration producingan overall blurred image; the inability of a lens to bring all wavelengths of light(especially red and blue) into the same plane of focus; usually present in regularlarge-aperture telephoto and super-telephoto lenses; does not improve by stoppingdown the lens; correctable through the use of Iow Dispersion (ED, LD SD) glass. Basically, this aberration is causedby light rays of different wavelengths coming to focus at different distances fromthe lense. Blue will focus at the shortest distance and red at the greatest distance.Since the natural rays of light are a mixture of colors, each aberration will givea different value corresponding to each color thus producing blurred images.</p><p><a title='bhphotovideo'>6</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ] Also known as color fringing, chromatic aberration occurs when the collective color wavelengths of an image fail to focus on a common plane. The results of chromatic aberration are most noticeable around the edges of high-contrast images, especially toward the edges of the frame. Chromatic aberration is most common on less expensive lenses, although even the best optics can occasionally display lower levels of chromatic aberration, under certain conditions.Another form of chromatic aberration is called purple fringing, which comprises the purple streaks or halos that often appear within images produced by digital cameras. Purple fringing originates in the light refracted from the light-gathering micro lenses that cap the sensor s pixels. In backlit scenes, this form of purple fringing is commonly called blooming. For more on this subject, see the explora article, ://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/optical-anomalies-and-lens-corrections-explained Optical Anomalies and Lens Corrections Explained.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>7</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ] Chromatic aberration, also called colour fringing or purple fringing, is caused by a lens not focusing different wavelengths of light onto the precise same focal plane and/or by a lens rendering a different magnification each of different wavelengths. These two different types of chromatic aberration can both occur in one and the same image. Chromatic aberration can be seen as colour fringing around the boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image. It most frequently occurs around the edges of the image, especially in wide angle shots. Despite begin called colour fringing or purple fringing, chromatic aberration can also affect black and white photography. Although a black and white image obviously has no colours in it, chromatic aberration can blur the image. </p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>8</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ] Common lens problem where different colors/wavelengths of light focus at different locations, appears as color fringes or halos in image.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>9</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> ] When white light (light containing many colors uniformly mixed so that the eye does not sense any particular color and thus perceives the light as white) such as sunlight is passed through a prism, a rainbow spectrum can be observed. This phenomenon occurs because the prism's index of refraction (and rate of dispersion) varies depending on the wavelength (short wavelengths are more strongly refracted than long wavelengths). While most visible in a prism, this phenomenon also occurs in photographic lenses, and since it occurs at different wavelengths is called chromatic aberration.There are two types of chromatic aberration: axial chromatic aberration, where the focal point position on the optical axis varies according to the wavelength, and chromatic difference of magnification, where the image magnification in peripheral areas varies according to the wavelength. In actual photographs, axial chromatic aberration appears as color blur or flare, and chromatic difference of magnification appears as color fringing (where edges show color along their borders). Chromatic aberration in a photographic lens is corrected by combining different types of optical glass having different refraction and dispersion characteristics. Since the effect of chromatic aberration increases at longer focal lengths, precise chromatic aberration correction is particularly important in super-telephoto lenses for good image sharpness. Although there is a limit to the degree of correction possible with optical glass, significant performance improvements can be achieved using man-made crystal such as fluorite or UD glass. Axial chromatic aberration is also sometimes referred to as longitudinal chromatic aberration (since it occurs longitudinally with respect to the optical axis), and chromatic difference of magnification can be referred to as lateral chromatic aberration (since it occurs laterally with respect to the optical axis). Note: While chromatic aberration is most noticeable when using color film, it affects black-and-white images as well, appearing as a reduction in sharpness.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>10</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration </strong> ]  Color fringing that occurs when a lens does not focus different wavelengths (colors) of light equally.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>11</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration </strong> ] A phenomenon in which light rays passing through a lens focus at different points, depending on their wavelength. Axial chromatic aberration is a variation in focal length; lateral chromatic aberration, a variation in magnification. Lateral chromatic aberration: Light wavelengths differ depending upon color. Differences in the length of the wavelengths result in changes in image magnification and become visible at image peripheries. Lateral Chromatic Aberration is the cause of color fringing. Lateral chromatic aberration is reduced to some degree by combining different lens elements with different refractive indexes, but optically speaking, it cannot be completely eliminated. In addition to red and its complimentary color, cyan, and blue and its complimentary color, yellow, some lenses may exhibit complex color fringing that combines these two primary types. It is greatly reduced by low-dispersion ED glass.</p><p><a title='Underwatter Photography'>12</a> [ <strong>chromatic aberration:</strong> ]  A type of distortion that manifests itself as ‚Äúfringing‚Äù of colors along high-contrast boundaries.

									<p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>1</a> [ <strong>circle of confusion</strong> ] Since all lenses contain a certain amount of spherical aberration and astigmatism, they cannot perfectly converge rays from a subject point to form a true image point (i.e., an infinitely small dot with zero area). In other words, images are formed from a composite of dots (not points) having a certain area, or size. Since the image becomes less sharp as the size of these dots increases, the dots are called circles of confusion. Thus, one way of indicating the quality of a lens is by the smallest dot it can form, or its minimum circle of confusion. The maximum allowable dot size in an image is called the permissible circle of confusion.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>2</a> [ <strong>circle of confusion</strong> ] Tiny disc of light. Images formed by a lens are made up of these discs.

A standard value of CoC is often associated with each image format, but the most apprpriate value depends on visual acuity, viewing conditions and the amount of enlargement. Properly, this is the maximum permissible circle of confusion diameter limit, or the circle of confusion criterion, but is simply called circle of confusion.Real lenses do not focus all rays perfectly, and so, even at best focus, a point is imaged as a spot rather than a point.

									<p><a title='BetterPhoto.com'>1</a> [ <strong>coating</strong> ] A layer or multiple layers of thin anti-reflective materials applied to the surface of lens elements to reduce light reflection (flare) and increase the amount of transmitted light.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>2</a> [ <strong>coating</strong> ] When light enters and exits a lens, approximately 5% of the light is reflected back at each lens-air boundary due to the difference in index of refraction. This not only reduces the amount of light passing through the lens but can also lead to repeating reflections which can cause unwanted flare or ghost images. To prevent this reflection, lenses are processed with a special coating. Basically this is carried out using vacuum vapor deposition to coat the lens with a thin film having a thickness l/4 the wavelength of the light to be affected, with the film made of a substance (such as magnesium fluoride) which has an index of refraction of n, where n is the index of refraction of the lens glass. Instead of a single coating affecting only a single wavelength, however, EF lenses feature a superior multi layer coating (multiple layers of vapor deposited film reducing the reflection rate to 0.2-0.3%) which effectively prevents reflections of all wavelengths in the visible light range. Lens coating is carried out not only to prevent reflections, however. By coating the various lens elements with appropriate substances having different properties, coating plays an important role in providing the overall lens system with optimum color balance characteristics.</p><p class='span'>2 | COATING</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>coax, or coaxial cable</h2><p>A circular cable with single wire centered inside a shield, with insulating material and insulating jacket.

These LUTs are based on specific standards, such as SMPTE-C, SMPTE-240M, Rec-601-1, Rec-709, and Cineon.</p><p><a title='DXO Glossary'>87</a> [ <strong>color space</strong> ] Coordinate system representing the visible colors, under a given illuminant. The L* coordinate represents the luminance, while a* and b* represent color (respectively the green-magenta axis and the blue-yellow axis). The Lab color space was designed to be perceptually uniform, meaning that a same distance between two colors should be perceived as the same difference whatever those colors are.</p><p><a title='bhphotovideo'>88</a> [ <strong>color space</strong> ] The range of colors that can be reproduced on a computer monitor or in print.

The comet shape is oriented radially with the tail pointing either toward or away from the center of the image. The resulting blur near the edges of the image is called comatic flare. Coma, which can occur even in lenses which correctly reproduce a point as a point on the optical axis, is caused by a difference in refraction between light rays from an off-axis point passing through the edge of the lens and the principal light ray from the same point passing through the lens center. Coma increases as the angle of the principal ray increases, and causes a decrease in contrast near the edges of the image. A certain degree of improvement is possible by stopping down the lens. Coma can also cause blurred areas of an image to flare, resulting in an unpleasing effect. The elimination of both spherical aberration and coma for a subject at a certain shooting distance is called aplanatism, and a lens corrected as such is called an aplanat.</p><p class='span'>Canon glossary EU</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>combination printing</h2><p> A technique using two or more photographic negatives or prints to make a single image.

To help prevent the appearance of these artifacts in photographs Nikon has created the Comprehensive Dust Reduction System. This system uses a series of high resonance frequencies to vibrate the optical low-pass filter. This dislodges dust on the front of the sensor and reduces dust spots appearing on images. This system combined with the existing Image Dust Off system in Capture NX 2 provides a full dust prevention system for photographers.Sensor cleaning can be set to be performed manually when required by selecting the 'Clean now' setting, or automatically by selecting the 'Clean at startup/shutdown' setting. The 'Clean at startup/shutdown' setting has options for when the camera automatically performs an automatic sensor clean, either each time the camera is turned on, turned off or both.Sensor cleaning takes approximately three seconds to complete. If the shutter release is depressed during a sensor clean, cleaning will be cancelled.

									<p><a title='All things photography'>1</a> [ <strong>compression</strong> ]  A Digital photograph creates an image file that is enormous.

The benefit is that it takes less storage space and can be e-mailed quicker. There are two types of compression ‚Äì Lossy which permanently loses detail and Lossless that returns all the data. JPEG lossy compression is the common method for digital imaging and can be adjusted to offer low compression which maintains most of the quality or higher compression which starts to affect image quality. </p><p><a title='bhphotovideo'>4</a> [ <strong>compression</strong> ] A method of reducing the size of a digital image file to free up the storage capacity of memory cards and hard drives. Compression technologies are distinguished from one another by whether or not they remove detail and color from the image. Lossless technologies compress image data without removing detail, while lossy technologies compress images by removing some detail. Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is a lossy compression format supported by JPEG, PDF and PostScript language file formats. Most video formats are also lossy formats. TIFF files are not and, as such, are far more stable than JPEGs and other lossy file formats.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>5</a> [ <strong>compression</strong> ] The process of reducing the bandwidth or data rate in a video or audio signal. Often used with audio and video to reduce storage and transmission costs. Compression techniques common in digital imaging rely on removing both redundant data and data that is deemed less critical or imperceptible to the viewer. This can be done either within a frame (intra-frame compression) or across multiple frames (inter-frame compression). Compression systems are developed to reduce perceptible losses, however most compression systems in use today will exhibit some level of distortion.</p><p><a title='RadioShak support'>6</a> [ <strong>compression</strong> ] The process of reducing the size of a file.

'Compression' results in a smaller file that contains almost all the same information. The most popular compressed formats used by cameras are .jpg or .jpeg formats. If there is a loss of information from compression, it is called 'lossy compression.' Saving an image as a .jpg or .jpeg is a method of lossy compression, since some information is discarded. RAW files are uncompressed. Many digital cameras permit the photographer to select the degree of compression (e.g. Standard, Fine, Extra-Fine or Superfine) for an image the photographer is about to take. A 'Standard' image will show more loss of image detail than an 'Extra-Fine' or a 'Superfine' image, which will show minimal detail loss.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>9</a> [ <strong>compression </strong> ] Refers to reducing the quality of digital data in an effort to conserve storage space.

When this occurs, the image they capture is cropped to the center of the image, effectively producing a higher level of zoom. Most of the dominant APS-C sensors, for example, have a 1.5X crop factor. A 50mm lens that works for portraits on a high-end camera with a full-frame sensor would be the equivalent of a slight telephoto 75mm lens on an APS-C camera.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>3</a> [ <strong>crop factor</strong> ] Describes how much an imaging sensor has been cropped in relation to its full-frame equivalent. It always describes how many times larger the full-frame is in relation to the cropped sensor. Take an APS-C sensor with a crop factor of 1.6, for instance. This indicates the sensor is 60% of the size of a frame of 35mm film. The crop factor is used to calculate how much of the equivalent of the full-frame field of view the cropped sensor will have with a lens. In order to calculate this, one multiplies the focal length of the lens by the crop factor. A 1.6 crop-factor, for instance, will give a 100mm lens the same field of view as a 160mm lens on a full-frame camera. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>4</a> [ <strong>crop factor </strong> ]  A number used to multiply a lens's actual focal length to express how much of an apparent increase you can expect in the effective focal length of any traditional 35mm SLR lens you use on a dSLR camera.

When the center of the image is in focus, the periphery is out of focus, and when the periphery is in focus, the center is out of focus. The degree of curvature of field is largely affected by the method used for correcting astigmatism. Since the image plane falls between the sagittal and meridional image surfaces, good correction of astigmatism results in small curvature of field. Since curvature of field cannot be improved very much by stopping down the lens, lens designers reduce it as much as possible using various methods such as changing the shapes of the various single lens elements making up the lens and changing the position of the aperture. In doing this, one necessary condition that must be satisfied to simultaneously correct astigmatism and curvature of field is Petzvals Condition (1843). Petzvals Condition states that a lens element is good if a result of zero is obtained when the inverse of the product of the index of refraction and focal length of that lens element is added to the total number of lens elements making up the lens. This sum is called Petzvals Sum.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>3</a> [ <strong>curvature of field </strong> ] One of Seidel's five aberrations.

Once coated, the paper can either be left to dry by air in a darkened room or heat dried with a hair dryer. The image is formed by contact printing using the sun, but because the process cannot resolve fine detail, working from a line negative is recommended. Once exposure is complete, wash the print in cold running water for around 30 minutes until all yellow is gone. To brighten the highlights, rinse the print briefly in a dilute chlorine bleach bath, or to lighten specific areas, use a brush and bleach diluted 1:32. As well as paper, Cyanotype prints can be made onto heavy cotton or canvas, but you should avoid exposing finished images to bright light, or they will fade. </p><p class='span'>2 | CYANOTYPE</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>cybachrome</h2>

Relating article inthis site: Depthof field.</p><p><a title='The Pollio Folio - Glossary of Cinematography Terms'>21</a> [ <strong>depth of field</strong> ] While a lens focuses on a single plane of depth, there is usually an additional area in focus behind and in front of that plane. This is depth of field. Depth of field increases as the iris is closed. There is more depth of field the wider the lens and less the longer the lens. There is a deeper area in focus the further away a lens is focused than there is when a lens is focused close. Depth of field does not spread out evenly; the entire area is about 1/3rd in front and 2/3rds behind the plane of focus. To factor together all these variables it is best to consult a depth of field table, such as the ones found in the American Cinematographer‚Äôs Manual.</p><p><a title='Guid to Film Photography'>22</a> [ <strong>depth of field</strong> ] oF) ‚Äì The area between the nearest and furthest objects that appear to be in focus. This technique is controlled by the aperture of a camera lens.</p><p><a title='Tom`s Guide'>23</a> [ <strong>depth of field</strong> ] ‚Äì The part of an image, from foreground to background, that is in focus. A shallow depth of field, appropriate for portraits, shows only a small portion in focus. Adjusting aperture is the main way to control depth of field. Large apertures of f1.4, f2.0 or f2.8 produce limited depth of field, whereas smaller ones such as f11, f16 or f22 are used for greater depth of field. A deep depth of field, often used for landscapes and group shots, captures virtually everything in sharp focus.</p><p><a title='Penn State Integrative Arts department'>24</a> [ <strong>depth of field </strong> ]  The area within which objects are in focus; a large depth of field allows a great range of objects to be in focus simultaneously, while a shallow depth of field offers a very limited area in focus. Depth of field normally depends on how far open a lens is (a lens works much like an eye, with the pupil opening or contracting to control light). An open lens (for example, f 1.4) creates a shallow depth of field while a stopped down (contracted) lens (for example f 16) creates a large depth of field.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>25</a> [ <strong>depth of field </strong> ]  The range of distance in a scene that appears to be in focus and will be reproduced as being acceptably sharp in an image.

Depth of field varies according to focal length of the lens, chosen aperture and shooting distance.</p><p><a title='bhphotovideo'>27</a> [ <strong>depth of field (dof)</strong> ] Literally, the measure of how much of the background and foreground area before and beyond your subject is in focus. Depth of field can be increased by stopping the lens down to smaller apertures. Conversely, opening the lens to a wider aperture can narrow the depth of field.

See Using the depth of field button in the Techniques section. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>29</a> [ <strong>depth of field preview button </strong> ]  Many cameras are equipped with a preview button that, when pressed and held in, stops the lens down to the preselected aperture, allowing you to see how much foreground or background are in focus.</p><p><a title='ritzcamera'>30</a> [ <strong>depth of field preview button: </strong> ] A switch, button, or electronic push-button that allows for preview of the depth of field of the set aperture in the viewfinder.

It is very useful for critical selective focus shots although some rightfully consider it no more than an approximation, others feel that an SLR lacking a depth of field preview function is greatly diminished as a creative tool.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>31</a> [ <strong>depth of field scale</strong> ] A scale on the lens that indicates how much of the subject, from the nearest to furthest point from the camera, will be in focus. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>32</a> [ <strong>depth of field scale </strong> ]  Markings on the barrel of a lens that show the depth of field for a particular aperture and a particular focus setting.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>33</a> [ <strong>depth of field scale </strong> ] A scale on the lens barrel with the markings of f/stops and distances, which shows the distance range that is in focus for a chosen f/stop.</p><p><a title='ritzcamera'>34</a> [ <strong>depth of field:</strong> ]  The zone, or range of distances within a scene that will record on film as sharp.

									<p><a title='ephotozine'>1</a> [ <strong>diffraction</strong> ] An optical effect which can soften photographs and make them less sharp. As long as light travels in straight lines, this phenomenon will not occur, but as soon as it starts to bend - disperse or diffract - when it has to travel through a hole so small that it has to squeeze through, it will begin to interfere with the quality of the final result. Although a negligible effect in most situations, it actually increases with smaller apertures. There is a break-even point at which the disadvantage of the diffraction of the light captured is still compensated by the advantage of extra sharpness due to greater depth of field. But beyond that point the softening effect of the diffracted light is only partly compensated by the sharpness due to the greater depth of field. Finding the break-even point can help prevent any negative effects of diffraction. And as a bonus it will limit the length of the exposure or the ISO needed to take a photo with a very small aperture. The difficulty is that the effect isn't the same for different cameras and lenses. The aperture isn't the only critical factor - the size of the film or sensor recording the photo counts as well, and so does the quality and the focal length of the lens. For those who don't want to get into complicated mathematical calculations in order to find the ideal aperture, it is good to remember that the sharpest results for most lenses are found around two or three stops below their maximum aperture. Especially cheaper lenses can give very bad results at full aperture. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>2</a> [ <strong>diffraction </strong> ]  A phenomenon exhibited by a light‚Äôs wave front when passing the edge of an opaque object (one that does not allow light to pass through it). The light becomes modulated, causing a redistribution of the light‚Äôs energy within the wave front. You will see it at the edges of the object‚Äôs shadow, in the form of minute dark and light bands. The edges of the shadow have a fuzzy appearance. Think of ripples meeting a rock in a pond. They go around the rock in a new series of ripples that can be seen on the sides of the rock. Light waves behaving in a similar manner are said to be diffracted.</p><p class='span'>2 | DIFFRACTION </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>diffraction:</h2><p> A loss of sharpness at 100% magnification as a result of shooting at too small of an aperture.</p><p class='span'>Underwatter Photography</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>diffractive optics</h2><p>Diffractive Optics, a revolutionary new lens optical technology that permits super-telephoto lenses that are significantly shorter and lighter than previously possible, while simultaneously improving optical performance by reducing chromatic aberrations and even spherical aberrations.</p><p class='span'>Canon glossary EU</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>diffuse lighting</h2>

For Kodak it is a series of four numbers, such as 7248. The '72' always stands for 16mm camera stock, and the same emulsion type is found in 35mm as 5248, '52' being the designation of 35mm. Fuji uses a system where the film‚Äôs emulsion type is a little more telling, such as 250D, which is daylight balanced film with an Exposure Index of 250. When picking out a stock to use the film speed, and in the case of color film, whether the film is daylight or tungsten, are the primary reasons for choosing a certain emulsion type. Allowances might also be made to achieve a certain look, as in using Kodak Vision, or Fuji film. Several different emulsion types are usually used on a project, fast for night scenes, slow for daylight scenes, etc. However, unless you are trying something novel, it is a good idea to shoot a single unbroken sequence with one emulsion type.</p><p class='span'>19 | EMULSION TYPE</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>emulsion:</h2><p> Used alternately with film, but refers to the coating on the acetate film base.

This figure, also referred to as the brightness index, is most important in low light. As a guide you should ensure the binoculars have a similar sized exit pupil to our own eyes' pupils. In low light our eyes' pupils open to about 5 to 7mm wide to allow more light to pass to the retina. So if you intend to use the binoculars at night, indoors or in dense woodland, choose a pair with a similar value exit pupil.

Early cameras only had a manual mode (M) where the user had to select the aperture and shutter speed manually to ensure the correct exposure. Over the years cameras have become more sophisticated and now offer several automated modes including Program (P) - a fully automatic exposure mode that sets the aperture and shutter speed; Aperture priority mode (AP) where the user selects the aperture and the camera sets the necessary shutter speed; and shutter priority (SP, or Tv on some cameras) where the user selects the shutter speed and the camera sets the necessary aperture. Auto bracketing (AB) takes a pre-selected number of photographs, one at the suggested exposure and one to either side, so you can be sure of one accurate result. There are also several subject-based program modes that we haven't listed here that tailor the camera for particular subjects such as sports (action), landscapes, portraits, or flowers (close-ups). Some digital cameras have black & white and sepia modes. Buying advice A full auto program mode is ideal for point-and-shoot photography, but it's also useful to have some control over the exposure. The beauty with digital is that you can see whether the camera has got the shot right by previewing the image on the LCD. If not, you try again. If there is no manual control you can often preset the exposure using an auto-exposure lock or exposure compensation. The subject based program modes are often a waste of time and don't really bring much to the package. Special effects modes on digital cameras are also throw-away because all these can be created using the computer later. </p><p><a title='kodak glosarry 1999'>56</a> [ <strong>exposure setting</strong> ]  The lens opening plus shutter speed selected to expose the film.</p><p><a title='Kodak cine'>57</a> [ <strong>exposure setting</strong> ]  The lens opening selected to expose the film.</p><p><a title='Guid to Film Photography'>58</a> [ <strong>exposure setting</strong> ] The combination of aperture and shutter speed used to expose film.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>59</a> [ <strong>exposure setting </strong> ]  The aperture and shutter speed combination used to expose the film in a camera.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>60</a> [ <strong>exposure simulation</strong> ] Menu selected, lets you preview different exposure settings on camera s LCD screen (Live View) before taking picture.</p><p><a title='DXO Glossary'>61</a> [ <strong>exposure time</strong> ] Time during which a sensor acquires ambient light.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>62</a> [ <strong>exposure value </strong> ]  The Exposure Value (EV) system, which originated in Germany in the 1950s, was created to be a simple to use substitute for the shutter speed/aperture combination at a given ISO, using a single number instead of a combination of numbers.

A panoramic view photographed from a considerable distance and made up essentially of landscape or distant background.</p><p><a title='Spring Hurst Cine'>5</a> [ <strong>extreme long shot (els)</strong> ] The subject or characters are very much to the background of the shot. Surroundings now have as much if not more importance, especially if the shot is in high-angle. A first way to consider these shots is to say that a shot lends itself to a greater or lesser readability dependent on its type or length. As the camera moves further away from the main subject (whether person or object) the visual field lends itself to an increasingly more complex reading - in terms of the relationship between the main subject and the decor there is more for the spectator's eye to read or decode. This means that the closer up the shot, the more the spectator's eye is directed by the camera to the specified reading. Shots, in and of themselves, can have a subjective or objective value: the closer the shot, the more subjective its value, the more the meaning is inscribed from within the shot; conversely, the longer the distance of the shot the more objective its value, the greater the participation of the spectator or reader in the inscription of meaning. other factors influence the readability of a shot. A high or low camera angle can de-naturalise a shot or reinforce its symbolic value. Take, for example, an ELS that is shot at a high angle. This automatically suggests the presence of someone looking, thus the shot is implicitly a point of view shot.In this way some of the objective value or openness of that shot, (which it would retain if angled horizontally at 90 degrees) is taken away, the shot is no longer 'naturally' objective. The shot is still open to a greater reading than a CUC, however; although the angle imposes a preferred reading (someone is looking down from on high). In terms of illustrating what is meant by reinforcing symbolic value, the contrastive examples of a low- and high-angle CU can serve here. The former type of shot will distort the object within the frame, rendering it uglier, more menacing, more derisory; conversely, when a high-angle CU is used, the object can appear more vulnerable, desirable.</p><p class='span'>5 | EXTREME LONG SHOT (ELS)</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>extremum</h2><p>A point on a curve where the curve attains its maximum or minimum value.

In other words, eyeline matching is based on the belief in mainstream cinema that when a character looks into off-screen space the spectator expects to see what he or she is looking at. Thus there will be a cut to show what is being looked at:: object | view | another character | Eyeline then refers to the trajectory of the looking eye. The eyeline match creates order and meaning in cinematic space. Thus, for example, character A will look off-screen at character B. Cut to character B, who-if she or he is in the same room and engaged in an exchange either of glances or words with character A-will return that look and so 'certify' that character A is indeed in the space from which we first saw her or him look. This 'stabilising' is true in the other primary use of the eyeline match which is the shot/reverse angle shot, also known as the reverse angle shot, commonly used in close-up dialogue secenes.

Nikon has maintained the basic structure of the mount for the 50 years of its use, and currently some 400 different NIKKOR lenses are compatible with the system.One of the biggest advantages of the Nikon F-Mount is that you're able to choose from a large selection of lenses including: AF NIKKOR and AF-S (Silent Wave Motor) and PC-E perspective-control NIKKOR lenses.By adapting and extending the capability of the F-Mount and NIKKOR lenses, Nikon has incorporated technologies like autofocus, advanced metering, distance information technology, electronic aperture control in G-Type NIKKOR, VR (Vibration Reduction) image stabilization and Silvent Wave Motor (AF-S) technology, thus maintaining a significant degree of compatibility and demonstrating an ongoing commitment to photographers.</p><p><a title='RadioShak support'>4</a> [ <strong>f numbers | f-stops</strong> ] A numerical designation (f/2, f 2.8, f3 etc.) indicating the size of the aperture</p><p class='span'>4 | F NUMBERS | F-STOPS</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>f-number</h2>

An f-number range might be f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11...To find the next aperture in a narrowing series, multiply by 1.4. F-numbers are arrived at by dividing the diameter of the opening into the focal length of the lens, thus a 10mm diameter opening on a 110mm lens is f/11.

The ratio of the lens's focal length to the diameter of the opening is the f-number, or f-stop. Due to the way the values are calculated, the smaller numbers (f1.2, f2.4) actually represent wider openings. Each full f-stop represents a doubling or halving of light. For this reason, photographers often describe shutter speeds in f-stops as well. For example, a shutter speed of 1/60 second is one stop less than 1/30 second.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>4</a> [ <strong>f-stop</strong> ] Also f/stop.

F-stops can be a little confusing, because the larger the number, the smaller the opening of the iris, and conversely the smaller the number, the larger the opening. The typical f-stop scale is 1.4 - 2 - 2.8 - 4 - 5.6 - 8 - 11 - 16 - 22. When the reading is between stops, this should be accounted for it setting the lens, however, it is much more clear, even if it sounds grammatically incorrect to the mathematically inclined, to say 'One third above 5.6' rather than '5.8' because it is very hard to judge the distance in decimals between numbers like 5.6 and 8, whereas 1/3rd above 5.6 is perfectly clear.</p><p><a title='Mir glossary'>12</a> [ <strong>f-stop</strong> ] Useful for determiningthe maximum flash to-subject distance for flash photography.</p><p><a title='Tiffan edu Glossary'>13</a> [ <strong>f-stop</strong> ] see Stop</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>14</a> [ <strong>f-stop </strong> ]  (f-stop or F/stop) A lens aperture setting calibrated to an f-number (see above).

F-stops are defined numerically:  f/1.4, f/5.6, f/22, etc. Larger, or wider apertures, allow more light to enter the lens, which calls for faster shutter speeds. Faster (wider) apertures also allow for selective focus (narrow depth of field), while slower (smaller) apertures allow for greater depth of field. Wider apertures are preferable for portraits, while smaller apertures are preferable for landscapes.

Stepping rings can be bought to allow one size filter to fit on a different size thread. It's better to step up (use a filter with a larger thread than the lens) to avoid corners being cut off resulting in dark edges to your pictures.

If the photo turns out to be rectangular or circular, and how distorted it looks, depends on the lens and the camera. There are basically two kinds of fish-eye lenses for photography: 1. Lenses that produce a circular image, typically 8 or 10mm lenses, used on 35mm cameras or full-frame digital cameras. They produce a circular image with dark corners (due to most photos being rectangular). A similar lens is available for digital cameras with a so-called cropped sensor. To achieve the same circular effect, it's a 4.5mm lens. 2. Lenses that produce a rectangular image. These lenses enlarge the image to cover the whole rectangular frame of a photograph. They are typically 15 or 16mm lenses. On a 35mm or digital full-frame camera they produce rectangular but still heavily distorted images without dark corners. The same lenses on a digital camera with a cropped sensor will still have a distorting effect, but less so. Fish-eye lenses used to be prime lenses only, but one company has gone so far as to produce a 10-17mm fish-eye zoom lens. This lens still produces distorted, curvy images, but zooming in lessens the distortion. </p><p><a title='f64.ro'>2</a> [ <strong>fish-eye</strong> ] Obiectiv cu unghi de cuprindere apropiat de 180 grade; deoarece nu este corectat pentru aberatia curbiliniara, fotografia obtinuta apare ca un disc.

TTL (through the lens) is the default mode, allowing your camera's processor to read the light when the flash comes on, and cut it off at the correct instant so it won't be underexposed or overexposed. Red-eye mode fires a brief light before taking the actual shot, to force your subject's pupils to constrict so they won't reflect red from their retinas back into the photo. Other modes include rear curtain sync, which fires late, to freeze the front of a moving subject while leaving a slight trailing blur behind it, and front curtain sync, which does the opposite.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>36</a> [ <strong>flash modes</strong> ] Many cameras now have a built-in flash that is used to take pictures inside when the light levels are low. The camera detects when flash is needed and automatically fires it, there are usually several other modes to increase the flash's versatility. Red eye reduction fires a pre-flash to prevent large red eye pupils appearing. 'Off' turns an automatic flash off so that the camera can be used with a long shutter speed for night photography. 'On' forces the flash to fire as a fill-in for daylight pictures that have harsh shadows or to illuminate a close subject in a night scene. Slow sync fires flash and records the ambient exposure, which is great for creating image trails and creative subject movement. </p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>37</a> [ <strong>flash off </strong> ] When a Nikon digital camera with a built-in flash is set to OFF, the flash will not fire, even if the lighting is poor, or the subject backlit.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>38</a> [ <strong>flash output</strong> ] Flash units often have a range of settings that controls the amount of flash emitted.

At the time of writing, most TVs are squarer than the newer widescreen TVs on the market. With these older sets, for every 4 inches/cm of horizontal screen size there are 3 inches/cm of vertical size, hence a 4:3 aspect ratio. Widescreen TVs have 5 and 1/3 inches/cm horizontal size for each 3 of vertical. Rather than write that as 5.333:3, we use 16:9. So fullscreen=4:3, widescreen=16:9. When a movie is played in fullscreen format for a 4:3 TV, the movie is almost always adjusted to fit. You may be familiar with the phrase 'this movie has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your TV.' What that almost always means is that much of the original picture has been thrown away, i.e. the pan and scan procedure has been used to pick the most appropriate pieces of the picture to keep because the old TV screen is the wrong shape to show the whole picture. In terms of home cinema, fullscreen is inferior to widescreen and is often considered to be an unacceptable format. The 4:3 shape TV is expected to become obsolete over the next decade as TV moves to digital and HDTV formats, which are widescreen based. DVDs often offer both fullscreen and widescreen formats, however many are already only available in widescreen and anamorphic format, so as to cater for the growing audience of home cinema enthusiasts who have already abandoned fullscreen.</p><p class='span'>imdb Movie Terminology</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>fully electronic mount system</h2><p>Development of the EOS system began with Canon's own body range-finding and in-lens motor drive system and fully electronic mount system, technologies that were developed in 1985 to quickly respond to the trend towards full-fledged autofocusing SLR cameras.

In the early 1970s, first French and then British and American film theorists began applying psychoanalysis to film in an attempt to discuss the spectator/screen relationship as well as the textual relationships within the film. Drawing in particular on Freud's theory of libido drives and Lacan's theory of the mirror stage, they sought to explain how cinema works at the level of the unconscious. Indeed, they maintained that the processes of the cinema mimics the workings of the unconscious. The spectator sits in a darkened room, desiring to look at the screen and deriving visual pleasure from what he or she sees. Part of that pleasure is also derived from the narcissistic identification she or he feels with the person on the screen. But there is more; the spectator also has the illusion of controlling that image. First, because the Renaissance perspective which the cinematic image provides ensures that the spectator is subject of the gaze; and second, given that the projector is positioned behind the spectator's head, this means that the it is as if those images are the spectator's own imaginings on screen. Feminists took up this concept of the gaze and submitted it to more rigorous analysis. Laura Mulvey's vital and deliberately-polemical article, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema (1975) started the debate by demonstrating the domination of the male gaze, within and without the screen, at the expense of the woman's; so much so that the female spectator had little to do, gaze upon or identify with. The exchange or relay of looks, (as it is also known) within film reproduces the voyeuristic pleasure of the cinematic apparatus but only for the male. In fact, given that woman is normally, both within the film and on screen, the prime object that is being looked at, (and thus controlled) much feminist film theory has argued that the gaze is male through and through. It has thus been held that by attempting to expose how woman is constructed cinematically as an object of the male gaze, it is possible to deconstruct the normalising or naturalising process of patriarchal (male) socialisation.</p><p class='span'>Spring Hurst Cine</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>gb </h2><p> Gigabyte</p><p class='span'>Photo Tips</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>gb/s</h2>

Wishing to avoid government regulation, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America created their own regulatory body and appointed Postmaster General Will H. Hays as head. His influence became so great that this body became known as the 'Hays Office'. The Hays Production Code for Motion Pictures was introduced in 1934, and by today's standards was extremely strict. It was mainly concerned with violence and sex, but had references to crime in general. After WWII, the growing popularity of television provided the public with more viewing choice. The Hays Office came under increasing fire for restricting the creativity of filmmakers, as it had defined specific requirements for depicting certain events. For example, under the Hays Code a filmmaker could not present revenge in modern times as being justified, nor could they depict details of how crimes were committed, or show a criminal profiting from crime. Following the Supreme Court's Miracle decision in the 1950s, films were recognized as protected under the First Amendment, and as such the Hays Office's demands were not legally enforceable. Films such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Blowup inspired MPAA president Jack Valenti to abolish the Hays Code as his first step in overhauling the certificates system in 1967.

HDR helps capture that range of brightness by taking several quick shots of the same scene, but with slightly different exposure settings, and then combining them.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>8</a> [ <strong>high dynamic range</strong> ] High dynamic range (HDR) processing is a technique achieved using software that takes the best tones from several exposures and combines them in one HDR image. The dynamic range is the range of brightness levels in a recorded scene from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. This is typically measured in f/stops and has always been a problem for film users shooting on colour transparency film, especially on films such as Fuji Velvia. The dynamic range is around six f/stops from the brightest to darkest points. And while colour negative and black & white film users have always had a few stops to play with, even at a maximum of around nine stops most photographic systems struggle with high contrasts scenes. Several software programs offer the possibility of combining differently exposed shots to one high dynamic range (HDR) image. Also see High Dynamic Range explained technique. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>9</a> [ <strong>high dynamic range </strong> ]  A series of techniques enabling a photographer to capture a wider range of proper exposure in all areas of a scene than can be recorded by a camera in one exposure alone. It is achieved by making a number of different exposures, usually through bracketing, to properly expose the brightest areas, the mid-tones and the darkest areas. The pictures (in this case, three) are combined using an image-editing application like Adobe PhotoShop into one image that shows detail in each of the areas.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>10</a> [ <strong>high eyepoint </strong> ] An extended distance from the eyepiece to the eyepoint.

									<p><a title='Columbia Film School Glossary'>1</a> [ <strong>high-angle shot</strong> ] A high-angle shot is one in which the camera is placed above eye level, creating a frame that looks down at the subject. Early examples of high-angle shots represent the point of view of a distant onlooker, as in James Williamson‚Äôs Attack on a Chinese Mission Station (1901) and Frank Mottershaw‚Äôs influential early crime film, Daring Daylight Burglary (1903). The consistent use of high angle objective, expressive shots taken from close to the subject emerges in France in the 1920s with films such as Jean Epstein‚Äôs l‚ÄôAuberge (1923) and Maurice L‚ÄôHerbier‚Äôs L‚Äôinhumaine (1924). Depending on the stylistic language established by the filmmaker, a high-angle shot may suggest that a character has lower status or is needier than another character. CLIP proposed: Wild River (1960) dialog between Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick It is tempting but inaccurate to read high angle shots consistently through an easy literal metaphor: in ‚Äúlooking down‚Äù on a subject, a high angle confers vulnerability and low status. If this were true, Hitchcock‚Äôs use of high angles would be illegible when, for example, in North by Northwest (1959), Van Damm decides to murder his mistress by pushing her out of an airplane. Extreme high-angles can suggest surveillance, such as in the following shot from The Conversation (1974): CLIP proposed: (Last shot of Conversation) High-angle shots can imbue a sub-human character to a subject, as in this shot from Taxi Driver (1976): CLIP: (Shot of Travis walking into diner) A high angle shot may reframe authority, as in this shot from Ousmane Sembene‚Äôs Moolaad√©, where Coll√© defies village traditionalists who seek to circumcise girls in her protection: CLIP: (Shot of Village in stand-off.)</p><p><a title='Penn State Integrative Arts department'>2</a> [ <strong>high-angle shot </strong> ]  A shot taken from above a subject, creating a sense of looking down upon whatever is photographed.</p><p class='span'>2 | HIGH-ANGLE SHOT </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>high-key</h2>

A histogram skewed toward the light or dark side of the range can indicate if your picture will be too contrasty, dark, flat or overexposed. Many cameras can display a histogram in the image preview so you can adjust settings beforehand.

It then aligns the two images to detect how much each pixel has moved. An appropriate amount of blurring, noise and chroma is extracted from each image, and a stabilized image is produced by processing the images while altering the synthesis ratio of both images.

Older prime lenses for film cameras usually had hyperfocal distance marks to aid in finding this magic sweet spot. With today‚Äôs lenses it is possible to calculate, just takes a bit more work and a hyperfocal distance calculator.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>4</a> [ <strong>hyperfocal distance</strong> ] The distance to the nearest point in the photograph that appears sharp when the lens is focused on infinity. </p><p><a title='The Pollio Folio - Glossary of Cinematography Terms'>5</a> [ <strong>hyperfocal distance</strong> ] The hyperfocal distance is a distance set on the focusing ring of the lens that will most efficiently use the Depth of Field present. A depth of field chart will list possible distances and graph out the area of focus at different f-stops. There does not necessarily have to be a subject to focus on at that distance.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>6</a> [ <strong>hyperfocal distance</strong> ] Using the depth of field principle, as a lens is gradually focused to farther subject distances, a point will eventually be reached where the far limit of the rear depth of field will be equivalent to infinity. The shooting distance at this point, i.e., the closest shooting distance at which infinity falls within the depth of field, is called the hyperfocal distance. The hyperfocal distance can be determined as follows: Hyperfocal distance = f¬≤ / (d ‚àô F) f: focal length F: F number d: minimum circle of confusion diameter Thus, by presetting the lens to the hyperfocal distance, the depth of field will extend from a distance equal to half the hyperfocal distance to infinity. This method is useful for presetting a large depth of field and taking snapshots without having to worry about adjusting the lens focus, especially when using a wide-angle lens. (For example, when the EF 24mm is set to f/11and the shooting distance is set to the hyperfocal distance of approximately 1.5m/4.9ft, all subjects within a range of approximately 70cm/2.3ft from the camera to infinity will be in focus.)</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>7</a> [ <strong>hyperfocal distance </strong> ]  Technically, it is the distance between the camera and the hyperfocal point (See below). But, in practice, Hyperfocal distance is a lens setting technique that allows you to shoot sharp pictures within a certain distance range (depth of field) without having to refocus.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>8</a> [ <strong>hyperfocal distance </strong> ] The closest point you can focus a lens and still have the depth-of-field including infinity when the lens is focused on infniity. On a NIKKOR lens that does not have a depth-of-field scale, you can calculate the hyperfocal distance by using the formula: H = f 2 / ( F x CoC ) where H is the hyperfocal distance in mm, f is the focal length, F is the aperture and CoC is a Circle of Confusion value (0.033 for 35mm film or an FX format camera or 0.020 for a DX format body).

									<p><a title='ephotozine'>1</a> [ <strong>interchangeable backs</strong> ] If the camera has interchangeable backs you can change a film mid-roll so you could shoot colour and black & white within seconds of each other. This is also useful if you have several users using a camera - each could have there own film back. It's also good to record specific subjects on the same roll of film. For example you're out walking and you could take flowers on one and landscapes on the other. Many medium-format cameras have the option of changing format with different backs. You could, for example shoot 6x7cm, 6x4.5cm and 35mm from the same camera using three different backs. Polaroid backs are also available for many cameras. This means you could shoot a Polaroid print and instantly check lighting, composition or exposure and then replace with the conventional film. </p><p><a title='ephotozine'>2</a> [ <strong>interchangeable focusing screen</strong> ] Many SLRs and medium-format cameras have interchangeable focusing screens. The benefit is that you can swap the standard split screen for a different pattern to suit the type of photography you are doing.

JPEG, with its 16.7 million colors, is well suited to compressing photographic images. A 'JPEG' image file name carries the extension 'jpg' - e.g. 'portrait.jpg' Many people refer to an image in JPEG format as a 'JPEG,' pronounced 'jay-peg'.) Most digital cameras save images as JPEG files, and some high-end cameras can be set to record both JPEG and RAW image files at the same time. Note: When working on an image in an image-editing program, you can avoid data loss due to compression when saving and re-saving the file by first saving the .jpg image as a .TIFF image, which is not compressed when saved.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>7</a> [ <strong>jpeg (joint photographic experts group)</strong> ] Standard method of image data compression used to reduce the file size of digital images.

With a detachable lens camera it's often possible to buy just the body with a lens of your choice.The amount of light passing through the lens is controlled by an aperture, which is often quoted with its maximum aperture setting.Buying adviceSLRs: If you intend buying a specific lens in the future make sure that it's available in the same mount as the camera you are considering or own. Also if you're upgrading cameras, buy one with the same lens fitting or one that can be adapted to save the cost of replacing all the lenses you own.Digital and compact cameras: A fixed lens camera can often be much smaller so could be selected if you need to travel light. It's also less expensive if your budget is tight. It's better, though, to choose a camera with a zoom if you can afford to, rather than using a digital zoom or cropping the picture later. Go for one with a wider angle zoom if most of your pictures will be landscapes, interiors or family group shots.Choose a version with a longer telephoto setting if you want to shoot long distance subjects, portraits and wildlife. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>10</a> [ <strong>lens </strong> ]  A true 'lens' is a single piece of glass (or other transparent substance) having one or more curved surfaces used in changing the convergence of light rays.

However, dictionaries have come to accept the usage of the term 'lens' to mean the entire photographic objective itself. A photographic lens will always be called a lens, even though it is not a lens, but has a lot of lenses in it.

'Letterboxing' is a video mastering process whereby a film source with an aspect ratio greater than that of the video master (4:3 for NTSC/PAL and 16:9 for HDTV) is transferred to the video master in such a way that no film image is cut off to the left or the right, requiring the addition of (usually) black bars at the top and at the bottom of the image so that it entirely fills the screen--in other words, the technique of shrinking the image just enough so that its entire width appears on screen, with black areas above and below the image. The advantage of this technique is that the film images are shown as originally intended by the film's creators, not interfering with their shot composition and artistic intentions. The disadvantage is that the entire image must be shrunk, which makes viewing on smaller TVs more difficult. Contrast with pan and scan (for DVD, also anamorphic widescreen).</p><p class='span'>imdb Movie Terminology</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>letterform</h2><p> Each letter of an alphabet can be distinguished from the others by its unique shape, or letterform.</p><p class='span'>Claire Trevor School of the Arts at UC Irvine</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>letterspacing</h2>

But computer systems need a much larger number of colours to process than human beings, since the human eye is more sensitive to any changes in some parts of the spectrum, while computers distribute the steps evenly across the whole colour spectrum.

The most basic is Centre-weighted (CW) or average metering that takes a measurement from most of the image area. A more sophisticated version of this is Partial (P) metering that has a narrow area of measurement that is still based on the centre of the image and Spot (S) that can measure from as little as 1 of the image. The most commonly used in more advanced cameras now is Matrix, also known as Multi-pattern (MP) or segment metering, that takes readings from several parts of the scene and produces a calculated average. Buying advice In most cases the basic metering with an auto camera is fine, especially if you have the sun behind you or it is overcast. But when you start to try more advanced shots, such as the sun behind the subject for a backlit halo effect or an archway with light streaming through the pillars or a spotlit subject against a dark background, you may find the standard meter will let you down. If you can see yourself shooting subjects like this, buy a camera that lets you switch over to spot or multi-pattern metering. </p><p class='span'>5 | METERING MODES</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>method acting</h2><p>A style of acting formalized by Konstantin Stanislavsky which is believed by some to create more realistic performances.

The lens is usually only half the physical length a regular lens of the same focal length would be, and 2. It's much lighter. Disadvantages are: 1. There is no adjustable aperture, so the user is forced to take all of his photos at a permanent aperture setting, usually f8, but sometimes even f11, which means you need plenty of light for taking photos; 2.

									<p><a title='Mir glossary'>1</a> [ <strong>mtf</strong> ] Modulation TransferFunction. The way people (who else, the magazines!) uses to measure a lens's abilityto hold diminishing details of a subject. Why MTF ? Because, everything is done electronicallyand eliminating any errors in human judgement or vision and results can be repeatableto counter check earlier tests. Secondly, a precise comprehensive rating is madepossible by incorporating huge amount of data into a single reading, lastly it isvery fast and permit its use on just out from production lenses.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>2</a> [ <strong>mtf</strong> ] Short for Modulation Transfer Function, a measure of spatial resolving power -- the ability of a lens or film, for example, to transmit information -- how faithfully the medium reproduces (or transfers) detail, acknowledging that whatever medium is being measured will introduce some degradation.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>3</a> [ <strong>mtf charts - how to read</strong> ] MTF charts (short for Modulation Transfer Function) provide a graph analyzing a lens ability to resolve sharp details in very fine sets of parallel lines, and a lens contrast or ability to provide a sharp transfer between light and dark areas in sets of thicker parallel lines. Fine repeating line sets are created parallel to a diagonal line running from corner to corner of the 35mm frame, directly through the exact center of the image area. These are called sagittal lines, sometimes designated S on Canons MTF charts. At a 90¬∞ angle to these, additional sets of repeating lines are drawn, called Meridional (or M) line sets. Repeating extremely fine short parallel lines spaced at 30 lines per millimeter measure the lens ability to record fine details, or its resolution. Even more important in the eyes of many optical designers is the lens contrast capability, which is measured with thicker sets of parallel repeating lines drawn at 10 lines per millimeter. At first glance, it would appear that any good lens would record lines running parallel to a diagonal drawn across the film with the same accuracy as lines drawn perpendicular to them. However, in real-world testing, this is often not the case. Especially in the Meridional direction, faithful reproduction of fine line sets becomes increasingly difficult as you move away from the center of the image toward one of the corners. And its a fact that almost all lenses produce sharper results in general near the center of the frame than at the outer edges. MTF charts display the lens performance from center to corner. Running along the charts horizontal axis, labeled 0 to over 20, is the distance from the dead center (0) of a 35mm image along a diagonal line to the corner of the frame, which is about 21.5mm away. On the charts vertical axis is a scale representing the degree of accuracy with which the fine and coarse line sets are reproduced, in both the sagittal (parallel to the diagonal of the film format) and meridonal directions. Solid lines on the MTF charts indicate the performance of sagittal lines (parallel to the diagonal of the film), dashed lines are for the perpendicular meridional test target lines. In theory, a perfect lens would produce nothing but straight horizontal lines across the very top of an MTF chart, indicating 100% accurate reproduction from the center of the picture (toward the left of the chart) to its outermost corners (at the right side of the chart). Of course, no such thing as a perfect lens exists from any SLR manufacturer, so MTF charts typically show lines that tend to curve downward as they move left to right (tracking the lens performance from center to corner of the frame). Canons MTF charts give results at two apertures: wide-open, and stopped down to f/8, with the lens set to infinity focus. While MTF charts dont include many factors that can be important when selecting a lens (size, cost, handling, closest focusing distances, AF speed, linear distortion, evenness of illumination, and of course features like Image Stabilization which may produce superior real-world results), they can indicate to the knowledgeable reviewer some of the optical characteristics they can expect from a particular lens.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>4</a> [ <strong>mtf modulation transfer function.</strong> ] A measure of resolution for lenses and/or film. </p><p class='span'>4 | MTF MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTION.</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>mu</h2>

RAW image files, sometimes referred to as digital negatives, contain all the image information captured by the camera's sensor, along with the image's metadata (the camera's identification and its settings, the lens used and other information). The NEF file is written to the memory card in either an uncompressed or lossless compressed form. imary benefit of writing images to the memory card in NEF format rather than TIFF or JPEG is that no in-camera processing for white balance, hue, tone and sharpening are applied to the NEF file; rather, those values are retained as instruction sets included in the file. You can change the instruction set as many times as you like without ever disturbing the original image's RAW data. Another benefit of the NEF file is that depending on the camera, it retains 12-bit or 14-bit data, resulting in an image with a far greater tonal range than an eight-bit JPEG or TIFF file.ture processing of the NEF file by Nikon's Capture NX2 software, or other imaging programs, offers greater control over the final image than the processing of a JPEG or a TIFF. After processing, the NEF file can be saved as a TIFF, JPEG or again as a NEF with the addition of any applied Capture NX2 processing saved inside the file as a second or alternate instruction set. As long as the original NEF file is preserved, the digital negative remains untouched; processing a NEF file does not alter the original instruction set.</p><p class='span'>4 | NEF - NIKON ELECTRONIC FORMAT </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>negativ</h2>

With CRC, the lens elements are configured in a ‚Äúfloating element‚Äù design wherein each lens group moves independently to achieve focusing. This ensures superior lens performance even when shooting at close distances. The CRC system is used in fisheye, wideangle, Micro, and selected medium telephoto NIKKOR lenses.</p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>13</a> [ <strong>nikon d</strong> ] D type lenses provide distance information as part of flash and ambient light exposure processes. D-type lenses also have a manual aperture ring. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>14</a> [ <strong>nikon dx</strong> ] DX is a lens designed exclusively for their APS-C sensored DSLRs, but can be used on their full frame cameras like 35 mm SLRs and full frame digital SLRs like the D3 series and D700 DSLRs. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>15</a> [ <strong>nikon ed (extra-low dispersion)</strong> ] ED glass enables lenses to offer superior sharpness and colour correction by minimising chromatic aberration. It is an essential element for telephoto lenses. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>16</a> [ <strong>nikon g</strong> ] G lenses do not have an aperture ring on the lens and must be controlled using the command dial on the camera. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>17</a> [ <strong>nikon hri (high refractive index)</strong> ]  HRI lenses can offer effects equivalent to those obtained with several normal glass elements and can compensate for both field curvature and spherical aberrations. Therefore, HRI lenses achieve great optical performance in an even more compact body.</p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>18</a> [ <strong>nikon if (internal focusing)</strong> ] All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the nonextending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most NIKKOR telephoto and selected NIKKOR zoom lenses. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>19</a> [ <strong>nikon m/a (manual auto mode)</strong> ] AF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon's exclusive M/A mode, that allows switching from autofocus to manual operation with virtually no time lag ‚Äî even during AF servo operation and regardless of AF mode in use. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>20</a> [ <strong>nikon ml (meniscus protective lens)</strong> ] A curved meniscus protective glass element is installed in front of the lens to minimise ghosting by diffusing light re-reflected from the image sensor or film and the protective glass. Using a meniscus protective lens ensures a clear image with little ghosting. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>21</a> [ <strong>nikon nano crystal coat</strong> ] Nano Crystal Coat is an anti-reflective coating. It virtually eliminates internal lens element reflections across a wide range of wavelengths, and is particularly effective in reducing ghost and flare peculiar to ultra-wideangle lenses. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>22</a> [ <strong>nikon rd</strong> ] Soft-focus shots of point light sources create regular polygonal shapes that reflect the shape of the opening created by the diaphragm blades. A rounded diaphragm uses blades designed to create a circular opening for a more beautiful soft-focus effect. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>23</a> [ <strong>nikon rf (rear focusing)</strong> ] All the lens elements are divided into specific lens groups, with only the rear lens group moving for focusing. This makes autofocusing operation smoother and faster. </p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>24</a> [ <strong>nikon sic (super integrated coating)</strong> ] To enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible amount. It also includes minimised reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior colour balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like Zoom-NIKKOR lenses. </p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>25</a> [ <strong>nikon standard </strong> ] The Nikon Standard for shots per charge battery information for its cameras is based on testing done by Nikon Inc.e: A Nikon D3 equipped with an AF-S VR 70-200mm f/2.8 ED lens captured 4,700 images when measured at 20 degrees C/68 degrees F under the following test conditions: image quality set to JPEG normal; image size set to L (large); shutter speed 1/250; shutter-release button pressed halfway for three seconds and focus cycled from infinity to minimum range three times; six shots taken in succession with the monitor turned on for five seconds and then turned off; cycle repeated once exposure meters have turned off. results will vary depending on factors such as temperature, use conditions and the number of times the battery is recharged.</p><p><a title='Wex Photographyc'>26</a> [ <strong>nikon swm (silent wave motor)</strong> ]  AF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon‚Äôs SWM which converts ‚Äútraveling waves‚Äù into rotational energy to focus the optics.

Linseed oil, made from flax seeds, adds gloss and transparency to paints and dries very thoroughly (within 3-5 days), making it ideal for underpainting. Stand oil is a thicker type of linseed oil, with a slower drying time (7-14 days), which is often diluted with (eg) turpentine, and used for glazing to produce a smooth, enamel-like finish with minimal traces of brushmarks. Poppyseed oil, much paler, more transparent and less likely to yellow than linseed, is often employed for white or lighter colours. Poppyseed oil takes longer to dry than linseed oil (5-7 days), so it is perfect for working wet on wet.

It contains many of the same data tables for information like encodings that were present in truetype fonts. Confusingly it is also used to mean the advanced typographic tables that Adobe and MicroSoft (but not Apple) have added to TrueType. These include things like contextual ligatures, contextual kerning, glyph substitution, etc. And MS Windows uses it to mean a font with a 'DSIG' (Digital Signature) table.</p><p><a title='ProximaSoftware Glossary'>2</a> [ <strong>opentype</strong> ] New font format developed by Adobe and Microsoft.

As jointly defined by Microsoft and Adobe Systems, it is technically an extension of Microsoft's TrueType Open format, which can contain either PostScript font outlines or TrueType font outlines in a single font file that can be used on both Macintosh and Windows platforms. It can also include an expanded character set based on the Unicode encoding standard plus advanced typographic intelligence for glyph positioning and glyph substitution that allow for the inclusion of numerous alternate glyphs in one font file.</p><p><a title='Font Shop Glosary'>4</a> [ <strong>opentype</strong> ] The most recent font format emerged at the beginning of the new millennium. OpenType was initially developed by Microsoft, which were later joined by Adobe. In a few years time it has become the new standard format for digital fonts. The biggest advantages shared by all OpenType fonts are their single file structure, cross-platform compatibility, and advanced typographic functionality. This means any single OpenType font file will work on both Mac and Windowssystems, and some OpenType fonts include expanded character sets and special features like automatic ligaturesand alternate glyphs. OpenType is the best format for most purposes. It comes in PostScript flavor (OTF) and TrueTypeflavor (TTF). While OpenType fonts will work on a basic level in most any application, the advanced features might not be accessible in certain software and older operating systems.

A two way pan & tilt head has a pan option to allow the camera to be rotated along a horizontal path and a tilt option to point the camera in up or down directions. A three way pan & tilt head also includes a swing control to change the camera from horizontal, landscape, format to vertical, portrait, format. The size and build of heads vary from model to model, so give them close inspection. The adjustment should be smooth to ensure accurate control - some models, often labeled video heads, use fluid to ensure a smoother operation. Check that there is no wobble once the handle and locking nut are secured. A few tripods come with a ball & socket head that is preferred by some photographers because it allows a quick adjustment of pan, tilt and swing movements in one go, but the camera platform is often smaller and overall they're more fiddly to control precisely. </p><p><a title='kodak glosarry 1999'>9</a> [ <strong>pan (panchromatic)</strong> ]  Designation of films that record all colors in tones of about the same relative brightness as the human eye sees in the original scene; sensitive to all visible wavelengths.</p><p><a title='Mir glossary'>10</a> [ <strong>pan (panchromatic)</strong> ] Designation of films that record all colors in tones of aboutthe same relative brightness as the human eye sees in the original scene, sensitiveto all visible wave-lengths.</p><p><a title='Kodak cine'>11</a> [ <strong>pan and scan</strong> ]  Technique used when transferring wide screen films to the standard 1.33:1 television aspect ratio.

Monochrome printing (mainly black and white) is commonly done using silver-based materials, such as are found in most ordinary photographic printing papers, to make paper photo-sensitive. They have an inherent impermanence. The prints won't last a long, long time. In the late 1800s, the platinotype process resulted in a more permanent print. Platinum is highly stable and wont tarnish in air. Instead of the image resting inside a binder on the surface of the paper, the image of a platinum print is actually absorbed into the paper's fibres. A platinum print takes on the texture of the paper. It is softer in appearance, appears to have more depth, has rich blacks and a highly-delicate tonal range. Platinum prints, in other words, are beautiful prints, with soft details, great tonal rendition and deep blacks. And, they are among the most permanent photographic images, capable of lasting perhaps thousands of years. They are ideal for fine art photography and the preservation and display of great photographs.</p><p class='span'>Photo Tips</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>play</h2><p>Functie a aparatelor digitale cu ajutorul careia sunt afisate imaginile inregristrate in memoria interna/cartela. </p><p class='span'>Fotomagazine</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>playback button</h2><p>Located on the camera back (blue arrow icon), when pressed displays images (including video) in camera s memory onto camera s LCD monitor.</p><p class='span'>canon glossary us</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>plein air painting</h2><p>refers to the spontaneous outdoor method of painting from nature - usually landscapes - as perfected by Claude Monet among others.</p><p class='span'>Vizual Art Cork</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>pliable</h2><p>Capable of being shaped, bent, or stretched out.</p><p class='span'>Moma</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>plotare </h2><p>Decuparea cu ajutorul ploterului (masina programata cu ajutorul calculatorului) a oricarui tip de format (ex: decuparea literelor si a figurilor pentru bannere).</p><p class='span'>Dictionar de termeni tipografici A</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>plug & play</h2>

									<p><a title='typographia glossary'>1</a> [ <strong>point</strong> ]  A unit of measurement, often used to measure type size, equal to 0.013837 inch. Some modern typesetting systems consider the point to be 1/72 of an inch, or 0.013888... inch.</p><p><a title='Font Forge Glossary'>2</a> [ <strong>point</strong> ] A point is a unit of measurement. There were three (at least) different definitions for 'point' in common usage before the advent of computers. The one in use in the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the 'pica point' with 72.27 points per inch ( 2.85pt /mm ), while the one used in continental Europe was the didot point with 62 2/3 points per 23.566mm ( 2.66pt/mm or 67.54pt/inch ) and the French sometimes used the Mediaan point (72.78 points per inch, 2.86pt/mm).The didiot and pica points were so arranged that text at a given point-size would have approximately the same cap-height in both systems, the didot point would have extra white-space above the capitals to contain the accents present in most non-English Latin based scripts. This has the interesting side effect that a font designed for European usage should have a smaller proportion of the vertical em given over to the text body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore this, so presumably european printers now set with more leading. As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in approximations to pica points (but this may be because I am in the US), PostScript uses a unit of 1/72nd of an inch. Originally fonts were not described by point size, but by name. It was not until the 1730s that Pierre Fournier that created the point system for specifying font heights. This was later improved upon by Fran√ßois Didiot (whence the name of the point). In 1878 the Chicago Type Foundry first used a point system in the US. In 1886 the US point was standardized -- the pica was defined to be 35/83cm, and the pica point defined to be 1/12th of that.</p><p><a title='Adobe Glossary of typographic terms'>3</a> [ <strong>point</strong> ] A unit of measure in typography.

This type of light is called natural light (or natural polarized light). If the direction of vibration of natural light becomes polarized for some reason, that light is called polarized light. When natural light is reflected from the surface of glass or water, for example, the reflected light vibrates in one direction only and is completely polarized. Also, on a sunny day the light from the area of the sky at a 90¬∫ angle from the sun becomes polarized due to the effect of air molecules and particles in the atmosphere.

The language contains the specifications of several different font formats. The main (FontForge) manual has a section describing how PostScript differs from TrueType. Type 1 -- This is the old standard for PostScript fonts. Such a font generally has the extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limited to a one byte encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be encoded). Type 2/CFF -- This is the format used within OpenType fonts. It is almost the same as Type 1, but has a few extensions and a more compact format. It is usually inside a CFF wrapper, which is usually inside an OpenType font. The CFF font format again only allows a 1 byte encoding, but the OpenType wrapper extends this to provide more complex encoding types. Type 3 -- This format allows full postscript within the font, but it means that no hints are allowed, so these fonts will not look as nice at small point-sizes. Also most (screen) rasterizers are incapable of dealing with them. A type 3 font is limited to a one byte encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be encoded). Type 0 -- This format is used for collecting many sub-fonts (of Type 1, 2 or 3) into one big font with a multi-byte encoding, and was used for CJK or Unicode fonts. Type 42 -- A TrueType font wrapped up in PostScript. Sort of the opposite from OpenType. CID -- This format is used for CJK fonts with large numbers of glyphs. The glyphs themselves are specified either as type1 or type2 glyph format. The CID font itself has no encoding, just a mapping from CID (a number) to glyph. An set of external CMAP files are used to provide appropriate encodings as needed. </p><p class='span'>4 | POSTSCRIPT</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>potentiometer</h2><p>Device measuring voltage, potential voltage difference, comparing with standard voltage.

									<p><a title='Mir glossary'>1</a> [ <strong>reciprocity</strong> ] Most films are designedto be exposed within a certain range of exposure times-usually between 1/15 secondto 1/1000 second. When exposure times fall outside of this range-becoming eithersignificantly longer or shorter-a film's characteristics may change. Loss of effectivefilm speed, contrast changes, and (with color films) color shifts are the three commonresults. These changes are called reciprocity effect. Generally, as a quick reference,exposure beyond one second needs to compensate for this characteristic of film.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>2</a> [ <strong>reciprocity </strong> ]  Refers to the relationship between a camera's shutter speed and its aperture when taking a picture or making an exposure reading. Proper exposure of a subject will have a correct aperture that corresponds to a correct shutter speed. If you change either one, the other must change reciprocally to maintain correct exposure. Most cameras have the capability to automatically adjust one or the other setting when you make a change to either one. AS the aperture decreases, the shutter speed is slowed, and vice-versa.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>3</a> [ <strong>reciprocity failure</strong> ] Reciprocity law states that as you increase the intensity of light reaching the film you also need to decrease the speed it reaches the film by the equivalent amount. Most films work quite happily between exposures of 1/2sec and 1/1000sec, but go beyond these extremes with a very low intensity of light and a long exposure or a very high intensity of light and a correspondingly short exposure and the law fails an exposure increase may be required when the shutter speed is beyond these limits. At these extremes the law fails. Compensation is required to adjust for this, but there is no strict rule to correct the error. Most film and paper manufacturers provide technical details on request with a rough guide to exposure adjustments. As a rough guide for an exposure of one second you would increase the speed to two seconds, or open the aperture by one stop. A speed of 10sec would need to be increased to about 50sec or open the aperture up two stops. With black & white film you only have to worry about this exposure correction, but with colour film does not only suffer from exposure problems but also colour casts. A colour film is made up of three individual colour layers, each layer suffers from reciprocity failure at different levels. On an uncorrected film the shadows may have a magenta colour cast but the highlights may suffer from a cyan cast. To correct the cast not only would a longer exposure be needed but also the inclusion of a colour correction filter of a low value, care would have to be taken in choosing the correct filter otherwise an over corrected result may appear. </p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>4</a> [ <strong>reciprocity failure</strong> ] When a film‚Äôs speed cannot be relied upon for proper exposure at slow shutter speed,reciprocity failure (or the 'Reciprocity effect') is said to occur. Additional exposure is required in order to achieve proper exposure for that film, even though your light meter may say differently. The additional problem of a shift in color balance that occurs with reciprocity failure can be more troublesome.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>5</a> [ <strong>reciprocity failure </strong> ] A phenomenon that occurs when film is exposed under conditions that are not within its practical brightness range.</p><p><a title='Kodak cine'>6</a> [ <strong>reciprocity law</strong> ]  Expressed by (H)=Et, where E is the light intensity, and T is time. When E or T are varied to the extreme, an unsatisfactory exposure can result.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>7</a> [ <strong>reciprocity law</strong> ] Aperture and shutter speed have a reciprocal relationship in making an exposure. Various different combinations of the two will produce the same exposure. The reciprocity law therefore means that an exposure provided by ∆í8 and 1/250 sec will gave the same results as ∆í11 and 1/125 sec., or ∆í16 and 1/60 sec., and so on. If one choice of settings provides proper exposure, then the others will as well. The reciprocity law states that Exposure = Intensity X Time. 'Intensity' is the amount of light, and 'Time' refers to how long that amount of light is allowed to act on the sensor or the film‚Äôs emulsion. The law 'fails,' however, when slow shutter speeds change the film‚Äôs apparent speed characteristics, making it seem to have a slower speed and resulting in color shift.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>8</a> [ <strong>reciprocity law</strong> ] To make an exposure, a photographer can, for example, choose a combination of a small aperture and a slow shutter speed or a large aperture and a fast shutter speed. Each movement of the aperture is classed as one stop ‚Äì go from f/8 to f/11 and you close the aperture by one stop. Similarly by adjusting the shutter speed from 1/125sec to 1/500sec you reduce the exposure by one stop. If you adjust the aperture by a stop and counteract this by also adjusting the shutter speed by one stop you will produce the same exposure value. Therefore an exposure of f/8 at 1/60th could be changed to any of the following combinations: f/11 at 1/30th, f/16 at 1/15th, f/5.6 at 1/125th or f/4 at 1/250th. This is called the law of reciprocity (if one value increases the other will decrease proportionally and visa versa). </p><p><a title='Tiffan edu Glossary'>9</a> [ <strong>reciprocity law (exposure)</strong> ] Exposure = Intensity x Time.

The red eye effect is caused by light from a flash traveling through the iris and illuminating the retina at the interior back of the eye‚Äì‚Äì which is red in color due to its blood vessels ‚Äì‚Äì and the camera capturing that redness on film or on a digital camera's sensor.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>3</a> [ <strong>red eye reduction</strong> ] If you've ever taken a photo in low light using a compact camera or an SLR with built-in flash you will have no doubt come across a strange effect - people with alien-looking eyes. The reason is simple; the flash lights up all the blood vessels in the eye which reflect back into the lens. The further away the flash is from the lens the less likely the chances of this strange phenomena occurring. The problem with built-in flash is that you can't control where the flash fires from. To overcome this, many cameras have a red-eye reduction mode, but it is, as the name suggests, only a reducer. It works by firing a pre flash to reduce the size of the pupils, and in doing so reduces the area of red. The redness is still usually apparent, but because the pupil is smaller the effect is less noticeable. There are three methods used in cameras to reduce red-eye. One is a single pre flash. This is quite bright and can fool the subject into thinking the picture has been taken. So you avoid red-eye but have a picture of a person either looking away or blinking. The second method fires a less powerful, but equally distracting, sequence of flashes, almost like a strobe. This can result in the unaware person shielding their eyes from the potential epilepsy inducing strobe! Version three tends to be the most subtle - a torch-like light that shines for about five seconds before the flash is taken. The only downside of this is battery drain. If you have a computer you can remove red-eye digitally using image editing software. If you don't there are special pens available that you can use to colour in the red on your photos. </p><p><a title='Fotomagazine'>4</a> [ <strong>red eye reduction</strong> ] SIstem de reducere a reflexului rosu cauzat de pupila mare care lasa sa se vada retina, bogat vascularizata.

Fluorites low index of refraction makes it possible to achieve significant reduction in lens length while maintaining high image quality. Although the extraordinary optical properties of fluorite were discovered in the 19th century and lens designers have long desired to use it, naturally formed pieces of fluorite large enough for use in lens production are extremely difficult to find. Deciding to solve this problem, Canon took up the challenge of developing synthetic crystals, bringing practical fluorite production technology on-line by the late 1960s.</p><p><a title='The Pollio Folio - Glossary of Cinematography Terms'>2</a> [ <strong>reduction print</strong> ] An optical reduction of a film from one gauge to another, such as 35mm to 16mm.</p><p><a title='Kodak cine'>3</a> [ <strong>reduction printing</strong> ]  See blowdown.

The resolution is the total number of pixels in the photo, for example, one million or 350,000. This is one factor that affects image quality, providing the image that's being formed on the CCD is sharp. CCDs with greater numbers of pixels should have higher resolution.

The resolution of the final photograph depends on three factors: the resolution of the lens, the resolution of the film, and the resolution of the printing paper. Resolution is evaluated by photographing, at a specified magnification, a chart containing groups of black and white stripes that gradually decrease in narrowness, then using a microscope to observe the negative image at a magnification of 50x. It is common to hear resolution expressed as a numerical value such as 50 lines or 100 lines. This value indicates the number of lines per millimeter of the smallest black and white line pattern which can be clearly recorded on the film. To test the resolution of a lens alone, a method is used in which a fine resolution chart is positioned in the location corresponding to the film plane and projected through the test lens onto a screen. The numerical value used for expressing resolving power is only an indication of the degree of resolution possible, and does not indicate resolution clarity or contrast.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>13</a> [ <strong>resolution (print)</strong> ] In printing, usually measured in dots per inch (dpi), number of individual dots printer can place on media.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>14</a> [ <strong>resolution (video)</strong> ] The detail an image holds.

Finished prints have a beautiful delicacy in the lighter tones, but slightly lack in detail overall. Images are contact printed onto art paper sized with starch and then rinsed and given a final wash in several changes of water. The final colour is normally reddish-brown, but by toning with gold a wider range of hues can be created, from reddish-brown to blue- or purple-brown.

'Chewing the scenery' suggests that actors are so engaged in their histrionic portrayals that furniture pieces and backdrops are left with big dental impressions.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>9</a> [ <strong>scene effect </strong> ] Incorporated into select Nikon COOLPIX cameras, the Scene Effect is an adjustment slider that allows you to adjust the intensity of certain scene modes. For example, the Food scene mode scene effect affects picture color, letting you make images more blue or more red; the Landscape and Close-up scene modes affect the saturation of the image, letting you choose between more vivid and less vivid; and the Sunset and Dusk/Dawn scene modes Scene Effect alters color, letting you choose to make the image more red or more blue.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>10</a> [ <strong>scene mode </strong> ]  Allows you to select one of a camera's pre-programmed exposure modes suited to the type of subject or setting being photographed to automatically give appropriate exposure settings (ISO, shutter speed and aperture) for each scene - e.g. Beach/Snow, Landscape, Fireworks, Macro, Night portrait, Night scene, Portrait, Dusk/Dawn, Sport, Kids and Pets, Food, Sunsets and more.</p><p><a title='All things photography'>11</a> [ <strong>scene modes</strong> ]  Many digicams now have an exposure mode called scene where the user selects the best pre-programmed scene to suit the current shooting conditions.

The scene modes automatically selects the appropriate exposure (shutter speed, ISO, aperture) for the particular scene the photograph is being taken in. Many COOLPIX cameras have upwards of 18 scene modes. Some Nikon D-SLRs also offer scene modes. Some of the many Nikon Scene modes are: scene auto selector, portrait, landscape, sports, night portrait, party/indoor, beach, snow, sunset, dusk/dawn, night landscape, close-up, food, museum, fireworks show, copy, backlighting, panorama assist, candlelight, pet portrait, blossom, autumn colors, silhouette, high key, and low key.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>14</a> [ <strong>scene recognition system </strong> ] Nikon's Scene Recognition System (SRS) recognizes the position, color, tones and characteristics of a subject or overall scene prior to capture; then, using information from the sensor, compares that information to the camera's built-in image database to achieve more accurate autofocus, auto exposure and auto white balance control. The Scene Recognition System's accuracy and precision are made possible by the image recognition capability of the sensor. Data supplied to the camera's system by the RGB sensor includes subject tracking and identification, highlight analysis and light source identification. Even changes of subject position within the viewfinder can be recognized as image information, and this capability is used by the autofocus system as a 3D-tracking function to give greater priority to the subject‚Äôs position. For subject tracking, the sensor recognizes the color of a subject within a user-selected focus point, then follows the subject‚Äôs movement by detecting the identical color segment. The 3D-tracking mode shifts the focus point automatically to respond to the subject‚Äôs movements. The AF and SRS are in constant communication with each other, improving tracking performance even for subjects quickly approaching the camera.As an auto white balance function, better image recognition combined with an advanced auto white balance algorithm achieves higher-performance white balance control.For subject identification, the SRS uses color information from the sensor to automatically detect people and skin tones. In this way it can quickly focus on the most important element‚Äîthe human face‚Äîin Auto area AF mode. Even if similar colors exist both in the foreground and background, the Scene Recognition System uses distance information from a D- or G-type AF NIKKOR lens to determine where the main subject is. </p><p class='span'>14 | SCENE RECOGNITION SYSTEM </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>scenic artist</h2><p>A member of the crew responsible for work which includes the preparation, painting and/or coloration of all textures, plastering, appliqueing on scenery, sets, and properties; the application of all decorative wall or surface coverings; all lettering and sign work (including signs and murals; miniature sets and/or models and properties and the painting and aging in the (construction) studio or on the set of costumes and costume accessories as specified by the costume designer.</p><p class='span'>imdb Movie Terminology</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>schema</h2><p>Tables and constraints describing a database structure.

Most cameras have a way of controlling how long the shutter stays open and this duration is known as the shutter speed. More sophisticated cameras can adjust from several seconds to speeds as rapid as 1/10,000sec. Cameras with wider ranges are usually more versatile.Buying advice: Look for a camera that has speeds way below 1/30sec. The longer the speed the lower the light you will be able to take pictures in without having to use flash. As an indication, a speed of around one sec is required to take street lit scenes and a speed of over 30 seconds for moonlit shots.

Absolute sensitivity is simply a measure of what level of light (exposure) begins to produce the first density signal in the film - this is known as toe speed.  The toe speed of a film can also be interpreted by a cinematographer as underexposure latitude or shadow detail. The blackness of a positive image D-max can also be used to define speed.  Most cinematographers would describe a film with smokier blacks as slower than a film with blacker blacks given both were exposed similarly.

									<p><a title='imdb Movie Terminology'>1</a> [ <strong>spherical</strong> ] AKA: Spherical PrintAn optical system in which the magnifications of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the picture are the same. See also aspect ratio, contrast with anamorphic.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>2</a> [ <strong>spherical aberration</strong> ] This aberration exists to some degree in all lenses constructed entirely of spherical elements. Spherical aberration causes parallel light rays passing through the edge of a lens to converge at a focal point closer to the lens than light rays passing through the center of the lens. (The amount of focal point shift along the optical axis is called longitudinal spherical aberration.) The degree of spherical aberration tends to be larger in large-aperture lenses. A point image affected by spherical aberration is sharply formed by light rays near the optical axis but is affected by flare from the peripheral light rays (this flare is also called halo, and its radius is called lateral spherical aberration). As a result, spherical aberration affects the entire image area from the center to the edges, and produces a soft, low-contrast image which looks as if covered with a thin veil. Correction of spherical aberration in spherical lenses is very difficult. Although commonly carried out by coming two lenses-one convex and one concave-based on light rays with a certain height of incidence (distance from the optical axis), there is a limit to the degree of correction possible using spherical lenses, so some aberration always remains. This remaining aberration can be largely eliminated by stopping down the diaphragm to cut the amount of peripheral light. With large aperture lenses at full aperture, the only effective way to thoroughly compensate spherical aberration is to use an aspherical lens element.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>3</a> [ <strong>spherical aberration </strong> ] One of Seidel's five aberrations. It is a variation in the focal length of a lens from the center to the edges, due to its shape. Spherical aberration appears as a halo, blur and loss of sharpness. It becomes more common at wide apertures, and can be reduced by stopping down the lens. It can also be reduced by the optimal combination of positive and negative lenses.</p><p class='span'>3 | SPHERICAL ABERRATION </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>spider</h2>

If you do provide a list, it's helpful to include a list of names of the wedding party and family. That way your photographer doesn't have to point at people when he needs them to switch places or look up at the camera.</p><p class='span'>TheKnot wedding photograhy</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>suite</h2><p>(appended to a font volume name) A discounted font volume.

One answer was found in the latter half of the 1970s with the appearance of UD (ultra low dispersion) glass that could provide characteristics similar to fluorite but at a lower cost. While the indexes of refraction and dispersion of UD glass do not equal that of fluorite, they are significantly lower than those of other types of optical glass. Moreover, UD glass does display partial dispersion characteristics similar to fluorite. The selection of the proper lens element combination in consideration of the intended focal length and other factors can provide close to the same effect as fluorite, (two UD lens elements are equivalent to one fluorite element). Another breakthrough was made in 1993 when Super UD glass was introduced as a new material that achieves almost the same performance as fluorite while achieving a new balance of greater cost reduction and even higher quality.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>15</a> [ <strong>super uniform fine grain</strong> ] Developed by Fujifilm for their Nexia APS films.

									<p><a title='ephotozine'>1</a> [ <strong>teleconverter</strong> ] Called 'extender', 'lens extender' or 'telephoto extender' by some manufacturers. (Not to be confused with an 'extension tube'!). A teleconverter is an accessory that fits between the camera lens and body to increase the focal length of a lens by 1.4x, 1.7x, 2x or 3x. When coupled with a 200mm lens, for instance, teleconverters would give these results: a 1.4x teleconverter gives an effective focal length of 280mm, while a 1.7x teleconverter increases this to 340mm, a 2x teleconverter to 400mm and a 3x to no less than 600mm. Teleconverters are compatible only with selected lenses, so always check with the manufacturer or retailer before buying. Although they will work with some zoom lenses, they're best used with (fast) prime lenses, since there usually is a drop in quality, and many prime lenses give a higher level of quality to start with. Besides changing the effective focal length, the effective aperture of the attached lens is increased by one or more stops as well. Autofocusing usually does not operate if the effective maximum aperture is greater than f/5.6 with the lenses/cameras from most manufacturers (in some cases greater than f/8, like on the Canon EOS 1V and EOS 3 cameras). And not all teleconverters support autofocus in the first place! </p><p><a title='Fotomagazine'>2</a> [ <strong>teleconverter</strong> ] Sistem optic pus in fata sau spatele unui obiectiv foto care mareste distanta focala si micsoreaza unghiul de cuprindere.

Put another way, it is the value of the distance from the apex of the frontmost lens element to the focal plane divided by the focal length. For telephoto lenses, this value is less than one. For reference, the telephoto ratio of the EF 300mm f/2.8L USM is 0.91 , and that of the EF 600mm f/4L USM is 0.78.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>17</a> [ <strong>telephoto type (teletype) lens</strong> ] With general photographic lenses, the overall length of a lens (the distance from the apex of the frontmost lens element to the focal plane) is longer than its focal length. This is not usually the case with lenses of particularly long focal length, however, since using a normal lens construction would result in a very large, unwieldy lens. To keep the size of such a lens manageable while still providing a long focal length, a concave (negative) lens assembly is placed behind the main convex (positive) lens assembly, resulting in a lens which is shorter than its focal length. Lenses of this type are called telephoto lenses. In a telephoto lens, the second principal point is located in front of the frontmost lens element.</p><p class='span'>17 | TELEPHOTO TYPE (TELETYPE) LENS</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>telephoto:</h2><p> A generic name for a lens with a focal length of higher than 50mm and an angle of view less than 45 degrees (with 35mm format.)

It used the albumen found in egg whites to bind the photographic chemicals to the paper and became the dominant form of photographic positives from 1855 to the turn of the century, with a peak in the 1860-90 period. During the mid-1800s, the carte de visite became one of the more popular uses of the albumen method. In the 19th century, E. & H. T.

UD (ultra low dispersion) glass made an appearance in the latter half of the 1970s, delivering a special optical glass which could provide characteristics similar to fluorite but at a lower cost and thereby answering another desire of lens designers. While the index of refraction and dispersion of UD glass are not as low as fluorite, they are significantly lower than other types of optical glass. Moreover, UD glass does display similar partial dispersion characteristics. The selection of the proper lens element combination in consideration of the intended focal length and other factors can provide close to the same effect as fluorite, (two UD lens elements are equivalent to one fluorite element). Super UD glass was introduced in 1993 as a new material that achieves almost the same performance as fluorite while achieving a new balance of cost reduction and higher quality.</p><p class='span'>4 | UD GLASS LENSES</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>udma</h2>

Then, in 1990, Canon developed the lower cost ring-type USM could be used in a variety of more affordable lenses. This feat was followed in 1992 by the development of a new type of micro USM that enabled the automation of production. Every day Canon comes closer to realizing the goal of equipping every EF lens with a USM. Features of the ring-type USM include its ability to easily achieve the low-speed, high-torque characteristics needed to realize direct drive. Large holding torque means the disc brake automatically holds the lens in place when the motor is stopped. Its construction is extremely simple, operation is virtually noise-free, and it demonstrates excellent start/stop response and control. High efficiency and low power consumption allow the lens to be powered by the cameras battery. The motors ring shape is optimally suited to lens barrel applications and its low rotation speed is ideal for lens drive purposes. Rotation speed control covers a wide variable range from 0.2 rpm to 80 rpm to realize high-precision, high-speed lens drive control. Variable-sensitivity electronic manual focus is also available. The broad operating temperature range of -30¬∫C to +60¬∫C (-22¬∫F to 140¬∫F) ensures stable operation even in severe environments. And, all lens drive control is performed by the microprocessor housed within the lens.</p><p><a title='f64.ro'>4</a> [ <strong>usm - ultrasonic motor (motor ultrasonic)</strong> ] Sistem de propulsie inventat de Nikon si perfectionat de Canon pentru a ajusta punerea la punct; sistemul determina rotatia unui inel prin deplasarea unei unde de suprafata intr-o piesa din ceramica piezoelectrica.

Vignette control does not apply to movies and its effects can't be previewed in Live View. Nikon Capture NX2 software also offers a Vignette Control tool that can be used to correct for vignetting on images that were captured with G or D type NIKKOR lenses. The Vignette Control tool can be used on NEF, JPEG, and TIFF files, however it is most effective when performed on images taken at maximum aperture. If the picture in the active image window is a RAW image taken with a lens equipped to transmit distance information (a type G or D lens) mounted on a camera that can record this information, Capture NX 2 will use the lens information recorded with the image to automatically select an optimal range for the Intensity slider.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>4</a> [ <strong>vignette mask </strong> ]  A special effects mask in front of the camera's lens that blocks the light around the scene's margins, producing a vignetted picture.</p><p class='span'>4 | VIGNETTE MASK </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>vignetting</h2>
									<p><a title='All things photography'>1</a> [ <strong>vignetting</strong> ]  The term that describes the darkening of the outer edges of the image area due to the use of a filter or add-on lens.

While correctable with filtration using on-camera, center-weighted neutral density filters, or electronically in Photoshop, vignetting is often valuable as a creative device to direct the eye back to the center of the frame.</p><p><a title='Canon glossary EU'>4</a> [ <strong>vignetting</strong> ] Light rays entering the lens from the edges of the picture area are partially blocked by the lens frames in front of and behind the diaphragm, preventing all the rays from passing through the effective aperture (diaphragm diameter) and causing light fall-off in the peripheral areas of the image. This type of vignetting can be eliminated by stopping down the lens.</p><p><a title='canon glossary us'>5</a> [ <strong>vignetting</strong> ] Reduced brightness or saturation at edges of image, compared to image s center.</p><p><a title='Mir glossary'>6</a> [ <strong>vignetting</strong> ] Underexposure of image corners produced deliberately by shadingor unintentionally by inappropriate equipment, such as unsuitable lens hood or badlydesigned lens. A common fault of wide-angle lenses, owing to reflection cut-off,etc. of some of the very oblique rays. May be caused in some long-focus lenses bythe length of the lens barrel.</p><p><a title='DXO Glossary'>7</a> [ <strong>vignetting</strong> ] Vignetting (or light shading) is a progressive attenuation of brightness of an image when going far from its center, meaning that the corners of a rectangular image tend to be dark. Read more about how vignetting is defined, measured and scored.</p><p><a title='Photo Tips'>8</a> [ <strong>vignetting </strong> ]  (1) When unintentional, it is underexposure at the image‚Äôs edges or corners caused by an unsuitable lens hood, filter or other attachment that partially blocks the field of view. (2) When intentional, it is an image printing technique where the central area is fully printed but its edges gradually fade. Vignetting can also be achieved when taking the picture by placing a vignette mask in front of the lens.</p><p><a title='Nikon Grossary'>9</a> [ <strong>vignetting </strong> ] Slight light falloff in the lens causes vignetting. Due to the physical properties of light passing through lenses it is impossible to get the same amount of light to the edges of the circle as the center (the light going to the edges has to travel further, thus falls off more).This light fall off creates a very slight reduction of exposure on the corners of an image. This darkening in the corners is called vignetting.Because light falls off (decreases) with the square of the distance it travels, light that travels farthest (from the lens to the edge of the circle versus from the lens to the center of the frame) will always be slightly reduced. All lenses exhibit some light fall off towards the edges but wide angle lenses as well as some telephoto zoom lenses are most prone due to their optical design. Further, a lens will generally show the most vignetting at it's widest aperture.With smaller format cameras (such as DX format D-SLRs) the light fall off is less noticeable because only the center of the circle of illumination is used. With larger format cameras (like 35mm film or FX format cameras) more of the circle is used and there will be more difference between the center of the frame and the edges.A second type of vignetting is called Mechanical Vignetting. This is simply vignetting caused by something blocking the light path such as a filter with too thick a mount or stacking several filters together. Also, using the wrong lens hood on a lens can cause mechanical vignetting.In most shooting conditions (proper exposure, normal subjects, etc.) light falloff will be minimal. However, at some f/stops, focal lengths and with some lenses it is normal to have more light falloff. If you have vignetting with a particular shot, change the lens focal length or aperture (lenses shot wide open will have the most vignetting, so stopping down a stop or two can help) until the vignetting is minimized. While vignetting may be easy to see and reproduce in a test situation, in real world shooting it is generally invisible.For those conditions where vignetting is obvious in a photo, Nikon View NX software will automatically compensate for vignetting and Capture NX2 software includes a Vignette Control slider to further reduce the visible effect without noticeably changing the overall image. </p><p class='span'>9 | VIGNETTING </p></div><div class='brake'><h2>vignetting:</h2><p> Light falloff in the corners of an image, usually when too small of a port or a filter blocks light from reaching the corners.

The definition most indispensable to the understanding of light as used in photography is 2 above. Types of electromagnetic radiation vary according to wavelength. Starting from the shortest wavelengths, electromagnetic radiation can be classified into (special form enter) rays, X rays, ultraviolet light rays, visible light rays, infrared light rays, far-infrared light rays, microwave radiation, ultrashort wave radiation (VHF), short-wave radiation, medium wave radiation (MF) and long wave radiation. In photography, the most utilized wavelengths are in the visible light region (400nm-700nm). Since light is a type of electromagnetic radiation, it can be thought of as a type of wave in the category of light waves. A light wave can be regarded as an electromagnetic wave in which an electric field and magnetic field vibrate at right angles to each other in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The two elements of a light wave which can actually be detected by the human eye are the wavelength and amplitude. Differences in wavelength are sensed as differences in color (within the visible light range) and differences in amplitude are sensed as differences in brightness (light intensity). The third element which cannot be detected by the human eye is the direction of vibration within the plane perpendicular to the light waves direction of propagation.</p><p class='span'>Canon glossary EU</p></div><div class='brake'><h2>whip pan</h2>

But to image sensors, that white may have a yellow, blue or green cast. White balance is an automatic or manual adjustment to a digital camera's color readings so whites appear to be white (and all other colors are also accurate) regardless of the illumination source.</p><p><a title='ephotozine'>3</a> [ <strong>white balance</strong> ] Artificial light appears in a variety of forms - tungsten and fluorescent being two of the most widely used. Each type of lighting produces a different colour temperature that our brain compensates for to make everything appear as though it's neutral light. Digital cameras and film are not so forgiving and record the colour as it really is, so in tungsten light the picture comes out orange/yellow and fluorescent goes green. These colour casts can be corrected using filters on a film based camera, and digital cameras have a white balance setting to make the pictures look like the view our eyes see. Some models have manual white balance control where you select the type of lighting from a list, but most take care of the colour automatically. </p><p><a title='f64.ro'>4</a> [ <strong>white balance</strong> ] La camere digitale: ajustare a redarii culorilor prin care se evita dominantele de culoare ce pot apare in diverse conditii de iluminare (soare, cer acoperit, lumina tungsten, etc).

Tips: For normal results, balance is done on a pure white card using the same light that falls on the Subject. In order to achieve abnormal color you can trick the camera by white balancing on a card or paper exactly opposite from the color desired. Some pros keep an assortment of colored cards handy for this off-white-balance operation.

Zooms are sometimes used in place of tracking shots, but the differences between the two are significant. A zoom normally ends in a close-up, a zoom-back in a general shot. Both types of shot imply a rapid movement in time and space, and as such create the illusion of displacement in time and space. A zoom-in picks out and isolates a person or object, a zoom-out places that person or object in a wider context.
